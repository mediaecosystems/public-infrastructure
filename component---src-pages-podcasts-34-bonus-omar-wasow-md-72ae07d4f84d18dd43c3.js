It looks at black-led protests between 1960 and 1972, and if I've got it right, the basic discovery is that nonviolent protests appear to have led to sympathetic media coverage and that appears to have led to Democratic victories at the polls.

And in particular, I'm standing on the shoulders of the activists who figured these insights out in the '50s and '60s.

There's a lot of work that looked at understanding the growth of the Civil Rights Movement. There was much less work on thinking about how that mapped to elections. It's clearly these are things that have been studied historically and there's a lot of sociological work, but in political science protests were a little bit at the margins of the field.

So there's a little bit of disciplinary boundaries that aren't very interesting and a little bit of..."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"All of which is to say that, to come back to the final question you asked, what brought me to this work, in some ways I think of myself as a child of the Civil Rights Movement.

Some of what allowed this paper to I think do work that was just, again contributing to a longer conversation was to try and link a bunch of different pieces where people had shown elements of it, protests maybe are influencing media, but less protests influencing media, influencing politics, and that they're differential effects when we see nonviolent and violent protests."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,Object(n.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman"),":"),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"One of the things that I love about this paper is the rigor of it.

That's not what this is about.\" I think that's one lesson for me is to just think about in certain contexts one needs to have a deep regard for what's the emotional resonant feeling people have.

That in some ways any criticism of what's happening on the ground is off limits. That's also what I think some of the buzzsaw that David Shor walked into and me as well is that there's just a sense of to raise any kind of question about this set of ideas or set of issues that we think are a just cause can still lead to...

You have the right to engage in civil disobedience. You go to court. That's how America's supposed to work, so we don't need to do anything.

I was watching coverage in the early Floyd protests of there's a Starbucks in LA that was getting vandalized, and CNN sat on that for 10 minutes.

A burning car will be an image in a newspaper account, and so it's not that violence can't... Media covers plane crashes, not plane landings, going back to the metaphor I used a moment ago. So violence is a very powerful way of drawing in the media, but if the focus of the camera is not on injustice, then I would say the evidence historically is that that will pull away from the larger cause.

Let me try to come back to some kind of clear takeaways. I think there is an opportunity. What we saw over the last year and a half is that certain kinds of narratives can punch through. So we saw there were police forces that criticized what happened in Minneapolis. You almost never see police forces criticize each other. There were conservative commentators who said what Officer Chauvin did was beyond the pale. So I think there is still fundamentally a capacity for capturing a moral high ground, for certain kinds of stories to capture the national attention and to move public opinion in ways that are consistent with what activists concerned about state violence might want people to be focusing on.
