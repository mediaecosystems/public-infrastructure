In six sessions over five days, there will be more than a dozen speakers whose work hints at what the internet could become over the next decade. Author and internet activist Cory Doctorow will speak about “adversarial interoperability,” an “elegant tool” that allows technical innovators to build new tools that interoperate with existing systems whether the owners of those systems like it or not.","url":"https://archive.org/download/reimagine-the-internet-conference-2021/%23Reimagine%20Conference%205.%20Cory%20Doctorow.mp3","embed":"https://archive.org/embed/reimagine-the-internet-conference-2021","youtubeEmbedURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlKDlBagkj0","duration":1152,"size":43900000,"explicit":false,"categories":["Technology","Government","Science"]}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
