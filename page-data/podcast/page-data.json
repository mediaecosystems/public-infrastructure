Welcome back to Re-imagining the Internet. My name's Ethan Zuckerman. I am thrilled today to have Maciej Ceglowski, one of my really favorite internet thinkers and someone I've read and admired for a long time. I teach Maciej's work every semester that I'm in the classroom. I always have a hard time explaining who he is. I usually introduce him as a standup philosopher, a travel writer, a software entrepreneur, but I think most critically you're a critical thinker and a debunker of the way many people think of the internet and how it works and someone who's actually looking to reimagine and reinvent the internet as it is.

As far as a thing, it is a B look marketing website, which depending on how old you are, that makes a lot of sense to you, or not so much sense to you. Back in the very early days of the web, a need that people had was to keep track of the stuff that they found. They would forget it and there were no good search engines for it. My good friend, Joshua Shackter wrote something called Delicious. It was one of those projects that got everybody's... A Velvet Underground thing where everybody who came across had wrote their own take on it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It was something I was terribly dismissive of at the time, but many years later when Yahoo had bought it and had started redesigning it, I asked Joshua's moral permission to clone the thing that it used to be. At that time I was living in Romania because my girlfriend was in the Peace Corps and I was in a precarious situation. I was hoping just to make a little bit of side income from it. Over time, it turned out to be a much better decision than I knew. It's been my full-time job now for 12 years. I charge people, I don't even remember what, something like 20 bucks a year and I keep track of their data.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It gives me a platform to stand on and shake my fists at the tech economy while not being, no offense, an academic. The fake story about Pinboard is that it's an example that you can have a small one person business that's sustainable and successful, but really if I wasn't funny and if I couldn't tweet, I don't think I could make this work the way it works. It's a little bit of a sham that this is a sustainable thing that everybody can do. It's taken me a bunch of years to come to peace with the fact that there's not really a room for these one person businesses.

I think when I initially signed up for it, the annual... First of all, I think it was initially a one time fee. I think you recently asked permission to make it an annual fee. I also think it iterated in cost. I think I got on at something like $13, but with each person who signed on it became a penny more expensive. Talk a little bit about these business models.

At the time, it was 2009. It was absolutely shocking to charge for a service because everything was free. There were a number of reasons for this. Probably one of the biggest was how hard it was to set up a payment gateway and how reluctant people were to type in their credit card stuff and so forth into the web. There was a lot of skepticism about even charging for a bookmarking site. Joshua gave me that great idea of actually having a incremental counter on the price. No matter where you got in, you were getting a better deal than the next sucker. I think it was 40 people meant one penny at one point or something like that. That gimmick actually gave me a lot of publicity at the time.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It also created a sense in people, which I hadn't realized was missing that the project might have legs and be sustainable because I was actually getting paid for it. There had been a site called Magnolia that had crashed and taken these bookmarks away. There was this real sense that you got in on the ground floor of someone's hobby project, and then it disappeared or got bought or went somewhere else and you were stuck. I was very pleasantly surprised that people responded so positively to the idea of charging money, as long as it was clear that money was being used to make this a long term venture.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of the things that was so interesting about Delicious... You and I are of the same internet generation. We were getting involved in the late 1990s, the early 2000s. Social media was merely a glimmer in people's eyes, but bookmarking was, of course, an early form of social media. Reading your bookmarks, reading Joshua's, reading others was actually a fascinating form of internet discovery. It also meant that these spaces were desperately personal and having Delicious get bought by Yahoo and then languish felt really hurtful. It felt really like something that I personally put a lot of time and effort into suddenly out of my control. Of course that is in fact what everyone is doing with Twitter, with Facebook, so on and so forth. Twitter in theory could shutter its doors tomorrow and your huge corpus of quips would be lost to the future because it's not even being archived at the library of Congress anymore. Why are we so willing to put up with this and has Pinboard made the argument that we shouldn't\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Maciej Ceglowski:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"First off, I think the situation has really changed because of the oligopoly in having these really big websites take over. Google's an exception because they have no hesitation about taking an entire project down after a couple of years. They rightfully get criticized for it, but Facebook it's pretty permanent and Twitter as well. That sense that we had maybe 10 years ago of, why should I bother contributing to this place or this community... Even Reddit is pretty permanent now. I think that's abated a little bit. People don't have as recent an experience of getting badly burned by this dynamic, which is, I think... Unfortunately it promotes this kind of monopoly internet and this boring internet that we have now, but it was a real problem at the time.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I always felt caught between two fires because in my intellectual approach to the web, I was very for things being ephemeral and not having this inhuman permanent memory. But I also run an archiving site, which is about the flip side of that, which is that things that have value to you shouldn't be unilaterally taken down. Even on Twitter, we saw when they finally decided to ban Donald Trump. They didn't just ban him. They took down retroactively everything he had said, which might not be a great loss, but the things that were in all of those threads, which have historical value, which have cultural value and which people had put time into contributing. They were all taken down too with no recourse. That feeling of no recourse, I'm a chump, I got played, I was used to help someone sell a company... That was a really bitter pill in our internet era.

Instead of one person and fragility, which seemed to be in some ways, what Pinboard was a reaction to... Now, instead we have implacable public companies with no ability to speak to them and no way to have discourse, except through lines of flax. You have very consciously chosen not to go down the economic path that most of these services exist on, which is basically the path of surveillant advertising. I know from both reading and teaching your work, that you're both very skeptical of surveillant advertising and its value, and also deeply worried about it as a business model. Can I get you to explore maybe this question of why advertising as we do it on the monopoly web right now is so problematic?

I circle around it, trying to figure out where to poke it with a stick to get a good howl out of it. One thing that I really worry about is the relationship between a surveillant society in the state. I think that in the United States, at least, that people see it fairly simplistically as the Edward Snowden model, where you have intelligence agencies that have enormous technical capacity to spy on citizens. They have to be reigned in and kept in check or we get a bad seventies movie out of it. I think the model that I'm very scared of is the Russia and LiveJournal model, where you have things that are kept forever in perpetuity, data that moves into unexpected hands and political situations that change in ways that could never have been predicted at the time that you created the things that are going to bite you later.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think that it ties into this idea of a permanent record being very inhuman. In pre-internet societies, you made maybe three or four irrevocable decisions in your life. It depends on how many kids you had, but you got married and maybe you chose a profession. These were very distinct moments. In the internet era, you do 10 of these before breakfast because you know that everything do is going to get tracked. Then it just stays tracked by default. I think that it's where living in that kind of a world meets the political system and the political problems that we're having across the Western democracies now, let alone in other countries.

I guess it's a talk more than an essay, but it's your talk at beyond tellerrand some years ago. As I said, I teach it every semester because I find it such a useful, critical stand on this question of big data and what the value really is here. You make an analogy to your family leaving Poland and Poland and East Germany and a number of other Soviet block nations trying to deal with the legacy of a surveillance society. Can I get you to talk a little bit about how those countries have navigated these records that in some cases are now 60 plus years old, 70, 80 years old, but still potentially, actually very toxic and very worrisome and a real problem for contemporary governments?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Maciej Ceglowski:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, in the Polish context, it was a fascinating moment after the fall of communism, where the fact that the secret police had kept files on so many people became a political weapon in which the existence of those files was used to smear people's reputations. It was imputed that you had been a snitch or you had spied on your neighbors. I believe the same thing happened in East Germany, but reunification reigned in the worst of the political exploitation of that stuff. There were a lot of political fights in Poland over who actually had control of these archives and whether anybody would ever go into them or not. It became a bludgeon that really damaged people who had Sterling character and really had shown guts and bravery under communism, under martial law, who then became \", \"[inaudible 00:12:34]\", \" as the foremost among them.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's a lot of problems with him, but he was a brave guy and he was not a communist stooge. Yet that is where things were taken. What interested me about this was it was the existence of these dossiers and not so much their contents that was the problem. Nobody also knew how to dispose of them. Even the people who wanted to get rid of them weren't clear on how you would do this. The Romanians solved us by just burning them in a panic before they could be examined. This is just a small taste of the problem that we have now, which is that we have dossiers on absolutely everybody. It's not just government dossiers. It's everybody's lives, the mundane details of where you are, your heartbeat, all these things that we collect.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We also have no capacity to secure this over the long term. Software is not capable of doing that. We have no plan for how to mitigate this. One of the paradoxes that I'm fascinated by is the fact that Facebook and Google are fairly ethical companies and they're competent. If they were like Rupert Murdoch run or if they were a complete disaster, we might have an easier time addressing some of these problems. But for now it's been very much like don't worry, trust us. There's a Robert McNamara mood of we're best of the best and we are just going to put pure brain power on the problem and solve it in perpetuity.

This is the Shoshana Zuboff critique that without consumers consciously accepting it, this bargain in which we're perpetually under surveillance in exchange for free stuff, is simply the world that we live in.

Does Facebook think all the data that it's hoovering up is valuable? Do the VCs believe this? do the new startups doing this, believe this?

It just happened because there's no regulation or law around it. There's no custom around it. This is a new thing in the world and so it will just do whatever it pleases until enough people collectively in some way, whether it's through customs, whether tribe gets angry, whether it's through laws passed in a democratic government, puts boundaries on it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think that's what happened with this surveillance economy. It turned out that you could make a lot of money by collecting data and running ads against it. You have some familiarity with that. There was absolutely no regulation around it.

We have a city where maybe half the population participated in lawful protest. They are all on record and they are being squeezed more and more with time. This is hanging over the heads of an entire generation of young people that they're tracked and they were tracked.

Is there a way to separate those encouraging and positive futures from the darker side of it? Is there a way in which someone like you who's really been quite successful in figuring out how to grab onto an alternative possible future and follow it to its logical end.

Half of the newsroom is programmers and half are more traditional journalists. And so we partner the traditional journalism with the data driven journalism and we feel like that can super power our investigations.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Give me a sense for how that's different from some of the work you were doing with ProPublica.

Essentially they're in a big newsroom like that, might be 10 data reporters for hundreds of other reporters to use as their partners. And so it becomes a little bit of a DMV situation, you have to take a number, wait in line. And I was always sort of in trouble a little bit for overusing the data resources. And so I would often have to go hire contract programmers to work with me because I believe strongly that we as journalists, we're outgunned, out spent and we have to use every possible tool in our arsenal.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And of course those tools tend to be human sources. Interviewing real people, documents, public records, but automation and computation can be one of those tools. And I really believe that we need to use all of those things in order to get the truth. And so the computation automation piece can be very scarce in these newsrooms. And so I wanted to build a newsroom where that was baked into the fabric from the beginning. One thing about The Markup is the data reporters don't report to a different data editor. They are part of the investigative team. They come up with investigative story ideas. They're true partners and it's not a service desk that's over strapped and under resourced, like I've experienced in other places.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The data reporters are the center of the equation.

And then we have Emmanuel Martinez who is a long time data journalist, already has a Pulitzer finalist from his work at Reveal and they have very different skills. We do some people are really good at scraping. Some people are really good at data analysis and statistics. Some are really good at just traditional public records requests and compiling those into data sets.

Those are actually super hard. And it's worth pointing out that the data reporters, the price point for them is higher because the market values them. But the truth is that the work by the human reporters is actually just as hard and sometimes harder. And particularly in a pandemic when you can't go out and knock on people's doors and at least you can, but you won't get as nice a reception. Not that we ever got such great reception as journalists, but we partner those two skills together.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I think one thing that's really important is that we believe that you can't analyze data in a vacuum. You can't just walk in and say, \\\"I want a dataset about X,\\\" and know nothing about X. A whole bunch of work happens before we collect data where we develop what we call domain expertise. The story you were mentioning about criminal risk scores that I did at ProPublica, we spent six months understanding and reporting about risk scores. What were the challenges? What were the issues before we went and collected data?

Now, of course, today in today's world where our entire life is mediated by technology and we literally have no relationships that don't involve technology, that is a pretty big beat. We do have a lot of latitude to operate, but an example of a story that we did that I think is indicative of how we work is the one we wrote about how Google was preferencing itself in search results.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Anyone who's ever searched for anything on Google has noticed that at the top of the search results, there's all sorts of little info boxes and video carousels and all sorts of stuff that is, I think, meant to be helpful, but it also means that the sort of links out to the outer world are pushed way down the page. And many of those links inside of the boxes, in the info boxes are actually just to Google itself. And so we wanted to measure this. Our reporter who'd been covering this topic for a long time, even before she came to The Markup, had heard from people who were like, my business was destroyed because Google pushed me so far down the page.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Like all good stories that started with a tip, and then we're like, okay, well, let's see if we can actually measure, because we love to measure things at The Markup. And so we're like, can we measure how much of the page they're taking up? It took a long time and Leon had to develop a way of actually analyzing the page. He borrowed from biology and the idea of staining a cell to see which parts of it were different than others. We actually scraped all these search result pages and then stained them to identify which parts were the Google products in which parts were links to the external web. And we were able to say at the end of the day that Google was preferencing itself quite a bit. 40% of the first page was their own products and actually 60% of the first screen, if you were really looking, thinking about it from a mobile point of view.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And we were really proud that that finding was of course used and referenced in the House antitrust landmark report and that in many of the Department of Justice and other anti-trust cases against Google have cited this because you can know something, but not know it until the data is there to support what you thought you knew.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And of course my next question was going to be about impact, but you've already anticipated it. I know this is something that ProPublica is incredibly thoughtful about is sort of maintaining almost a portfolio of impacts that a story can have. It sounds like you're having some of the same thing in sort of analyzing technical systems and particularly the sort of technical systems that we interact with every day, whether it's search engines, whether it's social media. A lot of our conversation on this podcast is about sort of diagnosing and then sort of envisioning fixes for social media as it currently exists.

We see ourselves as diagnosing these problems so that they can be solved. We don't have the perfect policy solution. We don't propose policy solutions, but I think when you get really close to a topic and really precise about the diagnosis, then the solution actually can more naturally reveal itself. We wrote a story recently about Facebook and how they had said they were stopping recommending political groups. And then our data showed that they didn't stop. And we have a hypothesis we haven't been able to prove, but it looks in the data like they just stopped recommending groups that self-identified themselves with a political tag. And that's a really easy thing to fix. There's plenty of machine learning they could apply to this to turn off anyone who is political and not just rely on that user identified tag.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And in fact, since our story ran, they have turned off political group recommendations. And I think maybe they applied that. I will never know. I'm not inside Facebook so I don't know how that is, but we see that as impact too. It's not just legislation. Unfortunately, the truth is like the federal government doesn't even necessarily have as much power as these companies and so much of what the impact is, is the companies themselves choosing to do something.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Let's look at Facebook specifically, not because it's the center of the universe and I think you and I would probably both agree that there are some platforms like YouTube that tend not to be as carefully looked at, but Facebook has some unique problems when you go to study it. The truth is what I am seeing on Facebook is not public knowledge. It's been put together for me as part of my Facebook feed. You don't have an easy way of seeing what's on my Facebook feed.

It's a really hard question and one that I've thought about a lot. And I ultimately came to the realization that we were going to have to do something pretty crazy in order to answer this question. And what that crazy thing was is a project called Citizen Browser. Basically we have built a tool, kind of a custom web browser that we distribute to panelists who we pay to install it on their computer. And they log into Facebook through this app and then they never touch it again. But it allows us to once or twice a day, take a scan of what's at the top in their newsfeed. We then put it through this crazy pipeline where we redact every bit of personally identifiable information about them and their friends and any comments and messages, anything personal, photos. And what we're left with at the end is a data set that we hope really shows what Facebook is choosing to push to the top of the feed.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This is the choice that Facebook has made, that they're going to put X and Y at the top and they're not going to put other things as high. And the only way to do that because everyone's feed is individual, is to build this panel. And so we've taken this panel approach, which has been extremely expensive and we've had eight developers, 10 months, it's an enormous effort. It costs half a million dollars a year in a run. I'm currently raising money for that so if anyone's listening, please send us a big check. And so, but I do think it's the only way, there may be other ways, but it's one of the best ways I can think of to try to monitor this black box.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of the analogies that I've sort of thought of for Citizen Browser is almost this notion of people creating their own network of air sensors. There are projects out there in places where we don't have very good readings of air quality, people buy a sensor, sort of hanging in their backyard and collectively we got a much finer grained set of detail.

And the reason for that is I had done something similar to this when I was at ProPublica called the Facebook Political Ad Collector, which we just offered to readers and ask them to donate. It looked at their feed and extracted ads and sent them to us so we could see what political ads were being shown. But the ProPublica readership was very liberal and so we basically only got liberal ads. And so it was a really limited and useful, but limited window into Facebook. And so that's why when I just wanted to take another stab at this question, I realized we're going to have to pay people so we could get a representative sample. We don't have, by the way, as many Trump voters as we do Biden voters. And that's how we're making the distinction on political affiliation.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"You could do it lots of ways, but that seemed like the most obvious way to do it in this year.

We still have a skewed panel, more Biden, but it means that we have a healthy representation of both sides. And so allows us to at least have a window into what this filter bubble looks like.

But I think that even the fact that we have a limited answer, meaning all we know is what the outcome was. We know the outcome. The outcome is the feeds look really different. How much of it is Facebook's fault? How much is the user? That we can't distinguish but I think it allows that conversation to begin and Facebook can then step in and say, \\\"Okay, well, we can respond by saying, okay, now that's not us.\\\" And then at least the conversation moves a little bit forward.

And it would say, not only do you want to target these ethnicities, but do you want to block these ethnicities from seeing the ad? I thought, well, huh, could you actually do housing discrimination this way? Because it's against a lot to advertise your housing to just one race or deny some people of some race to see the ad. And we bought an ad that was discriminated. It said, \\\"Don't show this housing ad to black people.\\\" And it went through and it approved. There was a big outcry, Facebook said they're going to fix it. They said they would build an algorithm to identify how these types of ads, they built the algorithm. And then I went in, tested it, bought the same ad, it still got approved.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I said to them at the time of the algorithm, I was like, \\\"You could build an algorithm to this. You could also just get rid of the dropdown menu that says block Black people from seeing that.\\\" I was like, I don't know, I'm not a super expert person, but that seems like an option. They're like, \\\"No, no, no, we have to build this massive algorithm.\\\" Then what happened is that not I but then the fair housing groups continued to buy ads after that.

Not only do we not have a national algorithmic auditing body, but as we've sort of established in this conversation, the only way to actually go ahead and audit these algorithms is either by buying ads on the services, which by the way, the services periodically complain is not a fair use of them. Or by starting to collect data through something like a panel. We're seeing other cases where Facebook has actually reacted pretty angrily to this. They've sent a cease and desist and put a demand date on it to the NYU Ad Observatory Project.

And the argument they made there is that that was not valid. Those people don't have the right to share that data. Yeah, they might make that argument to us. And I think that that's an argument that we should all have. Do we have any ownership over our own social media data?

It's not a secret that you have entered into with them. Beyond that is the sort of larger question of, if Facebook and these other companies let's be clear, it isn't just Facebook that does this. If an advertising company is enabling racial based housing discrimination, someone needs to be able to audit that. Maybe where we end up on this is having some sort of national audit bodies that are looking at these questions like racial discrimination. What are the things you most want to know at this point?

I also think the example that you just gave with Amazon is this great reminder that it's possible to be dumb as well as evil or even dumb instead of evil. As I understand the Amazon situation, they trained a machine learning algorithm on the people that they had hired and it turned out that they rejected lots of women so the characteristics of women on resumes like playing on the women's volleyball team or studying women's studies, all became negative indicators of what it would mean to be a good Amazon employee.

And so Amazon was probably always a really sexist place and there maybe no one had any sort of understanding of how that came to be and they could tune the dial. You can actually, now that it's a dial, you can turn the dial and to be like, okay, let's be less sexist. Now is the world going to make those choices? Is Amazon going to make those choices?

And when that is sort of the premise of the business or the platform, having a business model that doesn't interfere with that is... You know what I mean, like advertising can't come into play there because you're thwarting your ability to provide that service. So, we wanted a very straightforward relationship and to have a sort of motivation for ourselves to just make the platform good enough that people are, are willing to pay for it.

We saw classes sort of come and experiment with, and we'd hope to hold onto a few of them afterwards. Because there is an open, free version of this, you potentially face the problem that everyone else does, which is the problems of moderation.

And then, usually, it comes to just marking the channel as not safe work and adding a disclaimer to the description that these are for research.

The central component is a lot of the big players, folks that people know the names of. Fox News, Breitbart and the rest of those people and outlets that command lots of attention. Then you've got fringe players that most people outside of the ecosystem will not be familiar with where a lot of the stuff is even too crazy for Fox, kind of percolates and doesn't really go anywhere, but occasionally, sometimes something will surface from this periphery, make it all the way to Fox through the Trump administration, in many cases, it got all the way to the president and he would repeat it either in speeches or through his Twitter account.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That really is how information diffused and how the right decided its priorities in terms of activism, through this right wing media ecosystem, which in many cases was either elite driven or the elites would decide which aspects got to the forefront there.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Someone like Yochai Benkler, who's really made a lot of that case for that right wing ecosystem through a book like Network Propaganda, would probably go even further and say that it's been incredibly successful in that not only does it steer Fox News, but often the New York Times will come along with Fox News for fear of not covering these issues that are getting so much discussion and probably out of a misguided sense of false equivalence. So is this right wing strategy more successful than the left wing strategy? Are they just different? Do we have any evidence of the two crossing paths?

So just because at any given time, one appears more prominent than the other, that doesn't mean that that side would be more successful or should be considered more successful in general.

So if you consider something like right wing hashtag activism in presentations that I gave after the paper came out, I point out that during the Trump administration there were a number of hashtags that were basically boycott campaigns. Good examples of this were boycott Netflix and boycott Budweiser, both of which did supposedly \\\"woke\\\" things. And then it's like, oh, we've got to cancel them because they're doing things that we don't really like. There's been very little research done on those. We don't know what, for example, whether they're highly elite driven, we don't know how successful they were, how far they got and how much it actually affected the bottom lines of these companies.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So those were just anecdotes that I talked about. We know they exist, we don't know how widespread they were. The other piece of it is that you think about right wing media ecosystem, disinformation is a very key ingredient there, right? This is one key theme of Benkler and Hal's book. They try to answer the question, why disinformation is more prevalent on the right than on the left? And they really peg it to mainstream media. They say, well, mainstream media is a really good filter for this. They really kick out a lot of the crazier stuff. They're not totally immune to it, but if you look at it in relative terms, they're pretty good at filtering out some of the patently baseless stuff that really has a lot of cache on the right side of the equation.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So that is one theory as to why that exists and to whatever extent that's valid, I think that goes to explain a little bit why there is more disinformation on the right and how that becomes a strategy for activism on the right. Whereas it's largely, or at least relatively, eschewed on the left.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Although in some ways it's sort of a comforting thought for those of us who lean towards the left. Correct? We can say, well we're willing to work in the shared reality of universally agreed upon facts and for the right to make their argument makes sense, they need to put forward their own fact pattern that reality doesn't appear to support. I mean, just in terms of self-congratulatory left-leaning, that's a nicely confirming way of looking at that. And let me make it clear, I'm saying that as much to my friend Yochai as I am to you.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Do we have evidence of left wing disinfo? Do we have cases where we're seeing folks out on the fringes of the left, on the left equivalent of the gateway pundits of the world, who are manufacturing facts and scenarios, as well as interpretations?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Deen Freelon:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. This is something we address in the paper. As you know, it kind of puts people in a weird position if you are on the left, because we're aware that confirmation bias exists and, at least for me, I'm well aware of the fact of how it looks. Yes, the other side is the one that engages in all that terrible disinformation and we're all great. We totally agree with the truth and we, you know. So yeah, it's a self-serving argument. That doesn't mean it's not true, but as we point out in the paper and as I pointed out in subsequent presentations based on the paper, if you're going to make that claim, I think people need to work extra hard to make sure that the empirics of that are as rock solid as they can possibly be to counter those inevitable observations. And they're absolutely true, about the incentives and about confirmation bias and the rest of it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So yeah, I think the evidence is there. Actually, additional evidence has come out since the paper was published when you look at a lot of disinformation that really swelled around the 2020 election, which obviously didn't emerge until after the election had been called. That really supports that pattern of there being disproportionate amounts of disinformation on the right as compared to the left.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, you asked specifically about, is there a disinformation on the left? The answer to that question is yes. But when you're looking at it in an ideological asymmetry framework, the lens is always comparative or relative. So relative to the left, the right has more. I'll give you a couple of examples of left wing this information that we document in the piece.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of them is there was a situation... Actually, this example was documented in the Network Propaganda book. During the 2016 election campaign, there was a lawsuit or an allegation to the effect that Trump engaged in some kind of child sex trafficking or something like this, right? There's been no evidence to support this is actually true, but it pops up every once in a while. It popped up during the summer of 2016 after the book had been published... This is actually a really interesting empirical note. I don't think anybody's explored this. So if anybody wanted to do research on this, you definitely should. About a year ago, at the end of May 2020, Anonymous, the hacktivist collective, released a trove of documents that basically reported to supply some evidence that Trump actually had been engaged in this child sex trafficking incident.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Deen Freelon:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now this information was completely ignored by mainstream media, but it really had a lot of traction on Twitter, and I actually took a look at some of the accounts that were retreating this stuff, and they weren't political accounts. These were accounts that were mostly into things like anime and K-pop and other sort of pop culture type topics, and then all of a sudden Anonymous with the Trump child sex accusations pops up, and it's like, my first thought is, well, is this an automated thing? Is this some kind of bot network? Or, alternatively, could it be a situation in which people who are generally... People on the left, or people who don't like Trump, but who also generally don't pay that much attention to mainstream news, are now getting information from alternative networks like Anonymous, like other potential left wing sources that don't hue to very rigorous factual standards and spread this stuff around, and is it that much more powerful for them because they're not engaged with alternative news outlets that have those very strong pro-fact biases?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So again, I don't know the answer to these questions, it's just a very interesting empirical note at this point, but I do think it demonstrates the potential for there to be a left wing disinformation distribution networks, although all the evidence or most of the evidence that we have to date indicates that to whatever extent those networks exist, they're less robust and managed to spread less disinformation than their equivalents on the right.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So this is a paper from 2020. It's coming out before the 2020 election, and it's coming out really as a review of a lot of research within the field. It feels to me like there's been a little bit of a seismic shift.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I guess you can't have a little bit of a seismic shift.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's been a seismic shift in the space around mis and disinformation with what people are now calling the Big Lie, the insistence on winning the 2020 election. We're now at a point where more than 60% of Republicans believe that Biden is not a legitimate president. We've had 70% of House Republicans vote to overturn or not confirm at least part of the 2020 election.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"How do we study this once such central embrace of a conspiracy theory, something that near as we can tell has no factual basis, has actually become part of the Republican party? If one of our two parties is putting forward a false narrative, how do we even talk about this? What does this mean for the sort of analysis that you're doing in this paper?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Deen Freelon:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A great question, and I want to point out that this is not the first time that a large majority of either one party or even perhaps the entire Washington establishment has embraced something that is patently false. You can go back to something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident from the sixties that was based on something that was largely false. You don't even have to go back that far. Go back to the Iraq war and WMD. We're not even 20 years out from that, and that was something that, again, totally false. You can make your argument about whether they knew or not. I mean, I don't think we'll ever know who knew what at which time. Certainly the actions taken once it was revealed to be false, at least to me, were not consistent with what you should do when you find out you made a huge mistake.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But I think what's really important to understand here is that this is not without precedent. So the fact that a lot of people believe this, I don't think, is any kind of obstruction to empirical study of this particular phenomenon. I think we should just keep on the way that we have been in terms of chronicling the appeal of disinformation content like this.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It's interesting because in referring back to weapons of mass destruction and the Iraq war, going back to the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which we now know in retrospect was mostly constructed and certainly a large chunk of the administration knew that it was false. What you're almost pointing to is a presidential power to create alternative realities. That part of what comes along with the presidency is the combination of a sufficiently powerful bully pulpit that you're almost able to sort of fork reality as it goes. And suddenly we were living in a world in which Iraq had WMDs, even if we know that Iraq did not have WMDs. We suddenly have to actually deal with that universe.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What does that mean for Facebook? Facebook is under enormous pressure to combat mis and disinformation. Should Facebook, should Twitter be taking down all of these posts where people are insisting that Trump won the 2020 election? How should they be handling their responsibility for consensus reality, or is that a space that they shouldn't be getting involved with at all?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Deen Freelon:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That's a great question and one that I've been asked by a number of reporters over the past, gosh, nine months or so. And I think that the evidence on this point is quite clear, and that is that deplatforming works.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"When you take somebody who has been a widely acknowledged spreader of mis and disinformation off of that platform, the total amount of mis and disinformation spread unsurprisingly decreases. There was a New York Times analysis a few months ago that basically demonstrated when Trump was deplatformed from Facebook and Twitter, the degree or the distance that his words spread decreased by something like an order of magnitude. Is a huge, huge decrease.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's a big confounding variable in that, right?

He's no longer president and he's also, right. So a huge confounding variable. But one thing that's certain about confounding variables is when you look at the factor decrease, you consider the degree of impact that the confounding variable would have to have to completely eliminate the effect of the deplatforming. So I think the effect size really suggests that the deplatform probably... There are also other studies on deplatforming.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. He's not not our only example.

What are some of the takeaways that you and Charlton and Meredith and the other people that you've done such great work with on this have found about why these tools are so important for social change, that we want to make sure that we preserve, or that we pivot towards, as we think about the next generation of the tools?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Deen Freelon:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Okay.

This is not what I studied in grad school, so this could totally be wrong, but I'm going to say it anyway, because I have tenure and I'm going to flex it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I'm going to draw on a question that was asked to me in a seminar at some point over the last year. It was grad student who was saying... And this is a question that comes up a lot and it has come up ever since social media became a big thing, which is, why doesn't somebody just create some super distributed system that is not controlled by anybody, but anyone can get on it? And all this, all these kinds of things. Basically the question of, can we create alternatives to the social media platforms that currently exist that would not have so many of the same problems because they're not driven by the imperatives of capitalism, et cetera, et cetera?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"My feeling is the answer to that is probably no, and the reason has to do with the political economy of social media. Most people have no idea how much money it costs to run a globally distributed social media system. Twitter has nine figure users on there, hundreds of millions of users. Facebook has a couple billion. You need to start getting out your accounting sheets to try to figure out how much money this costs.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And so it's very difficult for me to imagine a social media system of that scale that exists outside of a capitalist system. When you have a platform that exists within a capitalist system, then you get stuff like, oh, we have to let the disinformation people on there because they drive engagement. They were at the top of the reach charts. Or, we have to let the white nationalists on here, because they're the ones that are paying for the ads. Their content really keeps people in the rabbit hole for longer.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So in some ways, the very system that allows activists to be able to engage in hashtag activism is also in many ways supported by algorithmic rabbit holes that lead people to white nationalism and disinformation that prevents people from, or that makes people think that vaccines are going to harm them and these sorts of things. From a political economy perspective, it's very difficult for me to understand how to separate those two things.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, that having been said, if you want to do something small scale, yeah, you can do that outside of a capitalist system. You can get your little mesh network together and put together something that is very small. But one of the reasons why people love social media is its scale, right? So if you want to find your high school buddy from 30 years back, you can get on Facebook and probably do it. 60, 70% of American adults are on Facebook, so you have a pretty good chance of success with that. That's unprecedented in human history, I'm pretty sure. Those network effects on a global level are, I think, one of the major attractions to these kinds of social media systems. Small scale systems simply can't do the same thing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This is a question that I think is incredibly difficult to reconcile. How do you maintain the advantages of a global social media platform while removing the incentives that the political economy itself creates? I don't know the answer to that question, but I think that it absolutely is a question worth asking and one that even if we can't completely separate the platform from its native political economy rooted in capitalism, we at least can try to pair down those edges and get rid of the worst aspects of it if we possibly can.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I don't know the answer either, and I'm very much feeling in your analysis, like, someone mucking around with mesh networks and very small communities, because that's certainly my hypothesis at the moment, that that's at the very least where we're going to have to start and learn some of the community management and some of the scaling pieces of it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The last guest I had on the podcast is Omar Wasow. We went back in time a little bit to talk about BlackPlanet and to talk about this moment in the early 2000's where it looked like people might have different homes online. You might have a home community where you were engaged in one type of speech. You might go hang out in other spaces and engage in different types of speech. And that ends up feeling really quite foreign now in 2021, right?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's this sense of we're all on Twitter, we're all on Facebook. Why would we need that small sub community? The flip side is that that might actually be a much more positive, much more supportive view of the internet in which we had communities that were much closer to having common interests and the possibility of self-governance. It's very hard to imagine a world in which three billion Facebook users with no common language, no common identity are able to step in and say, these should be the rules of the road, this is the conversation that we should have, but maybe it is the sort of thing where a BlackPlanet or an academic community or some smaller community could come in with a different vision.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"For me, that's the parallel track that I'm interested in. I am interested in, can we have spaces that are \\\"and\\\", rather than \\\"or\\\"? I don't want to get rid of Facebook. I love the ability to go back and find high school friends, but it'd be great to have a community where we as academics have our own space and our own rules of the road and so on and so forth. And I'm really interested to think about whether we could build those parallel tracks. Do you think we still end up falling down in the face of scale?

I think that we do have parallel tracks. Facebook is its own thing, Twitter is something different, right? It's been empirically documented people use Facebook and Twitter generally speaking for different purposes. So that's a parallel track. Instagram is another parallel track. There's a lot less politics on there because you can't post links, so it's very much a visual culture. Pinterest is something else. Snapchat is something else. I mean, Reddit is a really interesting example. To me, Reddit is like the second coming of the Newsgroups.

We've got so many different things. For academics you've got ResearchGate and academia.edu. Now, of course the corporate aspect of them is another question entirely, but they exist. There's some really, really great conversations that exist on ResearchGate that I've been able to benefit from. If you like to code there's Stack Exchange. I'm on there all the time trying to get my coding questions answered and not have people be too mean to me. So, yeah, absolutely. I think that there are different tracks for different kinds of things. What that does, I think, is it really raises the bar for any additional track to come in to answer the question of, what does this track do that existing tracks don't?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And that's a question that gets harder and harder to answer every day because people are always coming out with new stuff.

Who do I get access to? How do I benefit from communicating on this platform? I've already got my platform, so if I'm going to make room and space for that, the answer to that has to be very intuitive and very convincing for me to be able to try to engage with that, certainly on any longterm basis, even if I wasn't... Even if somebody I knew for example was doing it, and I was inclined to give them a little bit of time at the beginning.

How are these platforms and the interactions that are happening on top of them affecting our society and democracy?\\\" It's been kind of a rolling drama, I would say since 2018 in Cambridge Analytica in terms of what's been available and not available, so this was really our attempt to help them see the landscape clearly, to try to understand both what problems are out there that researchers, and journalists, and advocates are pursuing, and what the challenges and opportunities are around the data that they have access to from social media platforms.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"For the purposes of this report that we're working on, what's a platform?

I think, Ethan, you and I went back and forth on this question of, \\\"What is a platform and how do we define it for the purposes of this inquiry?\\\" Where we landed in defining platform is that these are essentially media platforms where users can post their ideas in various forms, so that could be text, or that could be audio, or that could be video, and these are usually free services, so they're monetized by advertising on the platform side, so the kind of like platform, traditional platform function of a social media platform is to really bring together those advertisers, marketers, the users who are creating content.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This includes Facebook and includes Twitter, it includes YouTube.

We turned in a draft of this before the Capitol riot, and we talked about the importance of being able to study platforms like Gab and Parler, and then suddenly, we had this very clear example of why it was so important to study them, so this is really a study of how researchers are trying to get information from these different platforms, what are the different strategies that they're using.

What does the spread look like? What does it look like when a particular piece of content goes viral or moves through a particular network?\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The real challenge, particularly on a platform like Facebook is that when you start to answer those content questions, you immediately bump up against this problem that the data that's available around reach is different than the data that's available around engagement.

I mean, one way to think about this is that a platform like Twitter is mostly a public platform, right? Generally, when you're tweeting, the vast majority of tweets are not protected, they're going out to the entire world, and you can look and maybe make some estimates about reach, how many people are seeing them. You can certainly see information like how many people liked them, how many people retweeted them and shared them. Facebook is a different critter, and most Facebook feeds are private.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"They're shared with a small number of people, and so even asking a question like, \\\"How often did this URL appear on Facebook?,\\\" can be somewhat controversial. You're basically asking for an aggregate of people's private sharing. Facebook reveals some of this information.

Many people liked it, many people shared it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What we don't know is how many people have seen a given post, the actual reach of these things, and so far, Facebook, for the most part, isn't giving us that data.

I'm a researcher. I generally just want to grab the platforms and kind of shake all the data out of them. You made a very convincing case that the platforms often have a really good reason why it's hard to share this data. Make that case for me.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. Sure. I think what I heard from our interviews about why it's hard for platforms to share this data is that at the highest level, there's a whole thicket of privacy regulations, both domestically and especially globally, coming out of the European Union, that actually make it legally risky for platforms to share this data. Those are not concerns that we should take lightly. The Cambridge Analytica scandal was a scandal because there was personally identifiable information that users did not consent to be released.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That was released to researchers and beyond, so those privacy considerations and the constraints on platforms that are created by those privacy regulations are real.

Social Science One was this very ambitious research effort, organized by a pair of just top social scientists to work with Facebook, to open up a data set, in particular, to study political influence and elections, instead of Facebook's role within it. Despite the fact that the academics who started the project had great contacts within Facebook, and despite the fact that the people the data was opened up to were a set of accomplished academics, had been very carefully screened, Facebook had a really hard time opening up the data, and many of the people who were involved with the project ended up just incredibly frustrated. One of the interesting things though, is that there's lots of what you might consider to be informal data collection. Tell us a little bit about some of the people like Pushshift, who are doing this work informally.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. I think part of the interesting finding for me and kind of doing this exercise of mapping the landscape on the methodology side is that people are really attacking this problem of platform data access in a variety of ways. Social Science One was the sort of official attempt to create a front door to some of this data for Facebook, but Pushshift and others are engaging in their own scraping of platform data, which is what we categorize in the paper as unsanctioned, so they are absolutely taking on some legal risk in doing this, but they are doing it and they are engaged in a kind of interesting and ongoing cat and mouse game, as some of these platforms attempt to shut off their access, and detect their scraping efforts, but that's really, that's a side door that some of these intrepid researchers are creating to scrape publicly available data, or data that you can get from a handful of kind of logged in users, and to collate that across platforms, so it's not just that there's a single platform under \", \"[city 00:12:06]\", \", but the really cool thing about Pushshift is that they're looking across platforms.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, Pushshift is remarkable.

We saw-\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Twitter as well.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What's that?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And Twitter as well.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah.

Can you talk a little bit about the NYU Ad Observatory?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. The NYU Ad Observatory created a browser plug-in that would allow web social media users like you and me to install this in our browser, and then they would collect data using that plug-in from our Facebook feeds. Now, sometime in, I want to say it was November, Facebook sent a letter to them saying, \\\"This violates our terms of service. Please cease and desist.\\\" This caused a kerfuffle amongst the researchers that we've been studying and working with because this kind of methodology is really one of those ways to get around some of these data access issues and to actually go right at the problem of user consent, so if you are a user and you are consenting to plugging this tool into your browser, you are essentially saying, \\\"Yes, researcher, it is okay for you to collect this data,\\\" and of course, for us, as researchers, who've been trained to respect user consent and to work with our IRB, is that's a hugely important component to doing high quality ethical research. It was a really interesting example of how, even if you can net out the problems of user consent, there may still be some residual platform resistance to those kinds of data collection methods.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Our early indications on the NYU Ad Observatory is that Facebook is making the argument that the users can't consent to do that, which is interesting, right? On the one hand, it's quite possible that Facebook's terms of service is interpretable in a way that says you can't give anyone unauthorized access to this. At the same time, it seems like what I see on Facebook is something that I should have control over, whether I share it with someone else. That isn't a trade secret, what Facebook is showing to me versus someone else. There are things that researchers want to study that just aren't likely ever to be released. Can you talk about people who are trying to study moderation decisions?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. I think, Ethan, you should weigh in here because I think some of those interviews were also yours, but part of what I heard in the, amongst the researchers who are looking at moderation decisions is that it can be very difficult. It can be very difficult to study takedowns kind of after they happen, and so getting some kind of deep retrospective like long-term longitudinal view of the outcome of those decisions can actually be incredibly difficult. It's also difficult to study at a policy level like to what extent the stated policies are actually being followed through and what the results of those are, and kind of what the distribution of those content moderation decisions actually is. I'm curious what you heard from-\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, I ... One of the things I would say is a lot of the research that people are doing is descriptive, right? It's basically, who's tweeting about what, and who's sharing what content, and what URLs are most prominent? When you start studying things like moderation decisions, you're often actually moving into the realm of an audit, and you're trying to ask the question of, \\\"Are a company's processes fair or not?\\\" For instance, Palestinians have long complained that their content gets taken down much more often than Israeli content does.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That's something that should be auditable, right? It should be possible to look in there and sort of say Israeli posts that are pro-Israel get taken down at this rate, pro-Palestine get taken down at this rate. Black Lives Matter protesters have complained about this. There's been a big dialogue within some black rights communities suggesting that criticizing whiteness is a way of getting taken down. It would be really nice to be able to sort of come in and evaluate those things. Those tend to be information that platforms hold very tight to.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Handing out information, instead of saying, \\\"Here is content that came in, and we decided to take it down,\\\" you can imagine the ways in which this could be very dangerous for a platform, right? This is content that they took down in part because they didn't want to get sued, or they were afraid of liability around that. In the long run, Elizabeth, how do we study these things? Is this something that independent researchers and journalists can study? Does the government have to get involved? Are there audit strategies that sort of get us there?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Do you mean particularly on the moderation front or in general?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I would say in general, right?

We're going to study it.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We have sort of a Julia Angwin camp that says, \\\"Put plug-ins in the browsers. Let's see it from the user point of view.\\\" That's almost certainly going to get litigated. There's a camp that says if the platforms were just good to citizens and gave us APIs, like Twitter recently did, we'd solve the problem, but it still seems like there's cases like moderation where we need something much closer to an audit system.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. Ethan, I think we together did a really good job coming at this with different perspectives and sometimes different opinions to assemble a range of options because, I think in this space, as in many others, there is no silver bullet, and so it really does have to be a combination of like cooperation, cooptation, and opposition, I think data collection strategies to get us there. Under the cooperation front, I think as flawed as Social Science One was, and as frustrating as it was for its participants, it's an important kind of first step to figuring out what a cooperative model looks like and what the constraints and interests are in both sides, and what happens when lots of talk about cooperation actually meets like governance and workflow decisions, and so my sense is, from talking with the researchers in this study, that will continue and that's a productive and important avenue to keep open, but that is not to the exclusion, I think of these oppositional efforts, for sure. It's also not to the exclusion, I think of regulatory approaches, some of which we can talk about. It's not to the exclusion, I think of the call for new civil society institutions that can do this because there are definitely whole sections of this problem that are not going to be solved by regulation, are not going to be solved by cooperation, are not going to be solved by individuals banding together in oppositional data collection, but can actually be solved by audit bodies, for example. \", \"[crosstalk 00:20:59]\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Let's dig into those two things.

That's another kind of like in the realm of the possible but difficult. The other, I think, interesting and important long-term kind of tectonic policy shift that I think would be very interesting is a complete reclassification here domestically of social media platforms as common carriers.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We had a couple of very interesting off-the-record conversations informing this report with folks in D.C. who really feel like a reclassification of social platforms under common carrier legislation would open up a range of rule-making possibilities that could really help us make progress on this researcher access and data access.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Part of what might become possible in a common carrier situation is that platforms might become significantly more auditable, and there might be a federal level regulatory response that said the platforms were auditable in certain ways. One of the wackiest ideas in this report that we ended up sort of putting out there is this idea that you might almost imagine algorithmic auditors who are not unlike the ways in which publicly traded businesses are fiscally audited to make sure that they're following best accounting practices. Of course, part of what happens in this is we don't know what a best algorithmic practice is. Our folks in the fair community, who are sort of trying to figure out questions of equity and fairness in AI, that's going to be a really, really open topic if we sort of get to that place. Elizabeth, let me say, for me, maybe the biggest surprise in all of this work was this idea of a tension between privacy advocates and researchers.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"No one, I think wanted to say, \\\"Damn, you privacy advocates,\\\" but it was often a situation where researchers who really want to understand what was happening on these platforms found themselves intentioned with privacy advocates, and of course, many of these players see themselves as allies.

It was hopeful because, I think the way one policymaker framed it to me was like, \\\"We have this legislation.\\\" It's not like we have to write something new. These powers exist.

It's pervasive, as we all know. And what I've really been focusing on lately is the challenges of what to do about it and what to do about it in ways that recognize not all harms are the same and not all young people have the same experiences online. And so, I'm really interested in where content moderation...so I kind of use that term with all the things involved with it...and where it's working for them right now and where it's failing them right now. And so some of the arguments that we could talk about are what are the ways that current platform governance, content moderation practices are maybe pretty dramatically failing any social media users, but certainly including young people as well.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So let's start there. First of all, maybe with the word \\\"moderation\\\", I'm seeing a lot of people in our field wrestle with questions of whether we should be talking about moderation or about governance. I feel like moderation is usually the appropriate term when we're talking about something being done to users rather than something being done with users. So for me, there are spaces like certain Subreddits that might be said to be governed, but most spaces are closer to being moderated. How do you feel like moderation is working with or against users on some of the platforms that are most popular with your research subjects? I know that you've looked at Instagram and Twitter and you may have thoughts on Snapchat and TikTok and some of the newer platforms as well.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Sarita Schoenebeck:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. And this is where this, really love this idea that you have about re-imagining because it seems like there's a lot of areas where we might reimagine what is content moderation, and are there other ways to think about maybe governance and other ideas? In a couple of papers now, I, and colleagues have made this argument that current content moderation practices, which is largely focused on removing content, so content that may violate user guidelines or community guidelines, and removing accounts, might be temporary or permanent removal, those are kind of the two mechanisms for moderating content. We've made the argument that they kind of rely on these criminal justice approaches, very Western punitive models that say, just something bad or offensive or wrong happened, and we're going to remove it, remove the content and maybe remove the person as well. And that's it, that seems to be how we're governing billions and billions of conversations daily.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And when I talk about criminal justice, these mirror kind of seemed to be modeled after physical criminal justice, offline criminal justice models, which at least in the U.S. are incarcerate people, they do it inequitably, they disproportionately harm people of color, disabled people, and so we think about those models and are they working well in other contexts, like in our criminal justice system. It doesn't seem like they're particularly effective either at helping people to change or kind of be held accountable for their behavior, nor are they in any way kind of dignified or appropriate way to treat human beings in my mind and many others, of course. And so this argument is that social media governance content moderation has adopted these models. So they identify perpetrators and then just kind of try to remove them.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The reasons I think it doesn't work particularly well is that they overlook the needs and the interests of the people who are targets of harassment. So the individuals or communities who experience harm are completely overlooked in content moderation processes, they don't try to address the harm or kind of rehabilitate or see what happened and how can we help people to improve their behavior in some way, or if that's needed. They're not transparent. So you mentioned procedural justice and we can talk more about that. And they also perpetuate kind of, or they risk at least perpetuating inequalities. And so concerns about content moderation processes as they're enacted now, which you can also come back to is that they may, again, just reinforce inequities and oppression, where again, say people of color, marginalized voices, disabled people, their content is removed without kind of an ability to say, \\\"Hey, this was an unfair removal, a false positive\\\" and things like that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It feels like there's even more parallels to the criminal justice system. One that crosses my mind is that there's basically no attempt at rehabilitation that in theory in criminal justice, incarceration is part of a process of rehabilitation and re-entry into society. In practice that happens far too seldom, and in fact, a lot of incarceration-based justice systems have essentially given up on rehabilitation, but in the same sense here, we're basically saying \\\"We're going to lock you up for a short period of time or permanently, which is to say you can't be on the system anymore, but we're not considering the possibility that you're going to return to our system and perhaps engage in the same behavior, nor as you mentioned, are we sort of addressing the harms that were suffered by the user who is targeted.\\\" Help me sort of think about what alternatives to this system are. What is a more rehabilitative justice or a restorative justice paradigm look like when applied to content moderation on social media platforms?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Sarita Schoenebeck:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It's a great question. And I'm excited to talk about it, but before I even kind of starting in that conversation, it's important to talk about restorative justice or other ideas like transformative justice are really complex topics. And so I do think they actually can be translated into social media governance and interesting ways, but we just need to be careful about how directly we can do it, in what ways we do it, the origins of those movements. And so we want to keep that in mind in these conversations that there's not simple kind of implementations, \\\"Do it this way, and everything will be great\\\". But the alternative models are, and these have been proposed as alternatives to criminal justice system, a prominent one is restorative justice, as you mentioned. And this is a set of movements, so lots of people in these movements will have different ideas about what it is and what it should look like.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But it's the idea that instead of sanctioning or punishing people, which just kind of reproduces more harm or creates more problems, oppression, whatever, we should instead try to think about models of accountability. So how do we encourage people to be accountable for harms that they perpetuate? And then some kinds of restorative justice talk about mediation, for example, where maybe the offender and the victim or the person who experienced harm come together with a mediator, community members, and one I mentioned we should be careful about these models when we think about taking them from one context and translating them to another, is things like these mediation models they've been used in kind of small local communities. The origins of restorative justice have been typically credited to indigenous communities in Canada and the US and New Zealand as an alternative pipeline from, from incarceration, kind of.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And so whether those would work online is a big open question because we don't have these small local communities with shared values and shared commitments to the communities, but, but the idea of accountability and, and not just going straight to punishing people for any possible offense, which is what happens now. I think that's compelling and there's a lot more we could do online to move there. I think a lens that will be hard for social media companies to adopt, but that needs to be really central, is one of power. And so I think that people who have been historically oppressed and marginalized in communities and societies in the US but also in various regions around the world, need to be most centered in thinking about the design of the solutions.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think whether we keep existing criminal justice models or use restorative justice models, unless they're done very carefully, they'll just perpetuate and bake in the inequities, and we already see that happening now. We could talk about the way those current practices now reinforce inequities, gender race, and things like that rather than fixing them. And so I think restorative justice, if it was just kind of slapped on to whatever existing processes happen, it would do the same thing as well. It doesn't just magically solve social issues.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So let's unpack sort of what often ends up going on, on social media right now. These spaces are notoriously desensitizing in the sense that people often engage in behavior online, that they would be significantly less likely to engage in offline, particularly around speech since for the most part, speech is the main way we can harm each other online, but people pick fights. People are abusive to one. Another people are insulting at rates that are probably higher than they would end up being in the physical world. In many cases, in most cases, their speech behavior, that's outside of the lines of a site's terms of service, you can report that you are being harassed and show the example of it to the moderators of a site, and they can or cannot take action on you. Other people can report you as engaging in hostile behavior or speech that sort of goes beyond those lines, and you may find yourself sort of subjected to this process of moderation as well. What works in that system and what doesn't work in that system?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Sarita Schoenebeck:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It's such a narrow set of remedies and processes and take some examples. It makes no sense that some 15 year old kid who said something horribly offensive once has the same outcome as Donald Trump. For example, they're both just banned, like in what world is... Would we say offline that these two incidences or trajectory should have the same outcome. Or take two people, maybe one uses really offensive language along with some really racist remark, and another person uses offensive language with something very anti racist training, both would also be banned, and in what world would we be saying,\\\"Hey, those should be treated similarly,\\\" or if we're parents and we're talking to our kids about this, these are not the same things. And so I think one of the things that's so constrained right now with governance is the really narrow set of remedies.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And by remedies, I mean, what happens when there's some violation of a guideline, if we take a harm-based approach, which aligns with these alternative justice frameworks, we can think about a much wider array of remedies, and so whether it's an apology and expression of intent to not do that again, a conversation, a little educational tidbit... And for all of these, they may or may not work. The idea is just, let's think about much broader way of interacting and having conversations, which mirror, what we imagine in communities. We think about healthy communities. We don't just kind of say something to someone, someone did something wrong and let's remove them and done. So I take a socio-technical approach to how we think about this, which means that there's the social behavior on the site, and then there is the design or the technical affordances and they shape each other.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And so I think that we can still protect important principles like speech while having a whole lot of other ways of handling behavior that is offensive or concerning or harmful, and also what to do about it, where maybe removing the content is a last resort, but not is not necessarily the first, second or third or the only route possible. So there's lots of other ways of trying to engage with people and give them opportunities to be more accountable before we get to that banning process. And I also think that will increase the legitimacy of banning if it's just for the more severe people who have not been receptive to changing their behavior, acknowledging harms, then yeah, I'm still okay with banning them. I haven't gone full like restorative justice, I guess, or I think there's limits where that framework applies here. And so I think it's just both at punitive and restorative models have a role in governance, but we should expand the repertoire and the kinds of remedies we might consider\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The idea of socio-technical systems help us understand why the standards are applied so bluntly and stupidly, in some cases: the 15 year old venting once versus the president of the United States. In a purely technical rules-based system, we consider what words are said. In the socio-technical system. We consider the context, we consider the positionality of the person saying things, we consider the context, how often has this been said, who's the audience for it, and is it likely to actually incite people to violence? Has it incited people to violence? But if we're just looking at the technical rule set, we start saying speech is speech, and we're going to treat it all the same way. Similarly what the platforms have come up with is a purely technical intervention. We will block that account either for a period of time or indefinitely.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Maybe it will cost you something depending on how much of your identity is tied up with the account, but maybe it costs you nothing, particularly if you had an account that no one was following and you simply go and create another one. I'm really interested as you start sort of expanding this repertoire, and it sounds like one of the spaces that you're most interested in is apologies. Can you talk to me about what this recent paper that you've written, which looks really deeply at apologies and how people feel about them, what might apologies do within the systems that we're considering?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Sarita Schoenebeck:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. Apologies can be a very important component of restorative justice frameworks and of the idea of accountability, and in one of our studies with US adults, and we asked about the idea of apologies and in general, they were positive about it, along with ideas like banning and removing content, so people can have a range of preferences about what to do when they experience harassment. But we also found that some groups were opposed to apologies, for example, the transgender participants in our sample were less positive about apologies, and that could be because they may feel they're not genuine. It could be because the idea of an apology may suggest some private communication and DM or, and it could open them to more abuse. I'm excited about the idea of apologies because it can amend a lot of harms in an interpersonal level or, you know, governments apologize too.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And that can be really meaningful signal. But I also think that apologies if they're forced, demanded, they can, again, exacerbate harm because we take like, let's take the example of someone posted racist content and someone posted anti-racist content, and they were both removed, asking the person who was posting anti racist comment, and maybe they're responding to something that to now apologize is just an egregious trajectory to imagine going down. So I think there's a lot of ways to move forward in this. One thing that I think is a really convincing argument is to say that people who are one time offenders or rare offenders, and I'm using the word offenders, we should say people who perpetuate harmful content, if this infrequent, is not routine, we should give them alternative pathways to acknowledge that they messed up. They made a mistake. They can express that they don't, they'll try not to do it again.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In that case, we may not need to remove or ban them necessarily. The people who repeatedly are harmful, they may be engaged in networked behavior that is incredibly harmful for the victims or the people experiencing it. Those can go straight to the punitive content. And that's something I think that companies can and should implement like, now. And, it's, they know who are repeat offenders, who are likely to be engaging in network harmful behavior. And they know who's probably just a one-time really messed up, a person who messed up one time and just needs a different pathway to reform their behavior.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Increasingly I'm of the opinion that moderation is the problem that the problem isn't a problem with moderation. The problem is moderation. That moderation implies that some group of people is going to enforce a set of rules, and your adherence to those rules is what matters, not your input into those roles or your discussion around those rules. To me, it feels like the healthiest communities are the ones that actually have robust conversations about what the rules should be, how we should deal with sanctioning, whether it's removal, whether it's apology, whether it's public shaming, whether it's any number of other things that people sort of involved with that. So for me, the experiments I'm really interested in taking on are: can we build small communities that are operating around governance rather than around moderation? What are some of the experiments that you want to do in this space? What are the experiments that would really get you closest to sort of answering your questions about what's wrong with moderation and what models that are closer to restorative justice might work in online spaces?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Sarita Schoenebeck:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Good question. And I love the, or I appreciate these shared concerns about content moderation and what it gets us and what it doesn't. I would love to see an ability to more easily move between sort of controlled lab studies, survey studies, where you can know about the people you're running the studies with. You can look for certain outcomes. For example, with some of the surveys I've been doing lately, we can ask people, tell me about yourself. What's your gender, what's your race, other things, and look at their preferences so that we can catch problems where we might say on average people like apologies, but they're really harmful for some groups. And I'd love to be able to move more seamlessly or transition from those kinds of studies to the field experiments, the online studies where concern would be, you might see really nice result, but you don't know if it's harming some groups in the process, even while it looks good for the site overall or whatever, and be able to kind of move between those two.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So maybe have pools of people online, where you know more about them. You can look for what safeguards are in place to make sure those who may be most harmed can be especially attended to and protected, and so, as soon as we realize, \\\"Hey, these measures look really good overall, but these groups they're not working for at all, we need to stop this\\\" and, and we need some kinds of accountability auditing independence. I think because the companies may not have much incentive to stop something that works for most people, even if it harms some people more. Some of the also powerful lessons are about different countries value systems.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So Jillian York has written about this, there's a variety of colleagues, Amna Batool, a PhD student who's looking at women's experiences of gender based violence in Pakistan, in a country like Pakistan, for example, social media is such a profound kind of cultural experience. For example, women maybe just have a photo of posted them online and it could be shamed, there's even honor killings based on social media postings. And so many things about governance too.

And this came out on a piece in slate recently about online harassment, particularly as it affects journalists, and particularly female journalists, journalists of color. This came in some ways out of some really terrible decisions that Slack made recently. Can you take us back to sort of Slack's design choices?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"For sure. So this piece came out of a residency I had with the Harvard Kennedy School called The Digital HKS Program. We were funded by The Open Technology Fund and we actually also worked with at Elise Vogel. And part of what we were interested in looking at is how design can play into safety and online harassment inside of platforms. And Slack is one that is just a space that just gets a lot of criticism and doesn't necessarily like to respond or adapt to it. And within that, one of the things we started looking at were what were different safety mechanisms, like block buttons, for example. Slack does not have that. And we ended up doing the research report before this new feature Slack had rolled out and we ended up writing our slate piece around the time Slack rolled out this feature where pretty much anyone could message each other on Slack.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think they called it 'global messaging'. You could apparently opt out of it, but you would still see a message from someone, like in your email. So there's still a way to sort of see that message. And it really sort of highlighted the lack of forethought or safety in terms of users. And it often makes me wonder, \\\"Well, who were they thinking of when they designed this?\\\" Slack tends to classically say that they are a work tool, that they are designing for teams. And on one hand, I want to hold them to that and say, \\\"Yes, I understand you're designing in a professional context, but you're kind of refusing to acknowledge that Slack is used and personal settings, if you will.\\\" And by 'personal' I mean, it's used by alumni groups, which is not in an office or it's used by groups of friends who want to talk with each other, or it's used by activists to organize different projects.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It's used for conferences to coordinate people discussing. So it's used in like all of these really sort of blurry areas. It's not just the office. And so I bring up the office because whenever we've pushed back to Slack, say, \\\"Why don't you have a black button?\\\" They were like,\\\"Oh, we feel like this cuts down professional communication in an office setting.\\\" And so this global DM tool they had, I'm sure they thought in their minds, \\\"This is going to be great for a company that's like the size of IBM or Google, that's above like 10,000 employees. And you just need to find someone, but maybe they're not in your right team.\\\" But that design in that context is one thing. But then when you apply it to, \\\"Oh, so anyone, in any Slack, could be messaged.\\\" And all of a sudden you can see how this could very quickly be weaponized, and be used to harm.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In some ways what's so problematic about Slack is not that they made this category mistake, right? So their category mistake is they assume that they are workplace tool. As we know, harassment, particularly sexual harassment, never ever happens in the workplace. So you'd never need to deal with something like harassment in those contexts. But even if we give them that category error and we sort of say, \\\"Slack, you think you're a work tool, but you're not purely a work tool. And therefore you have to think about harassment.\\\" Why are technology companies so bad at anticipating harassing uses of their tools? This just happens again, and again, and again. It's almost like harassers are endlessly creative, but rather than credit the harassers, in some ways, I just want to sort of blame the tool builders. Why are we so bad at anticipating misuses of our tools?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I feel like a recent book that's come out, Silicon Values, by Jillian C. York, covers this also. Part of it, I think one could argue, is that a lot of designers and a lot of tech companies could still design from a very north American US focused positive space. And we see this really embedded in modern design culture, particularly in product design and for-profit product design, that we only create like positive use cases in our mind of these tools. We don't necessarily take a security or threat modeling approach to design. And I'm thinking super broadly, but this is sort of what I've noticed, is like a fly on the wall and a lot of different corporate settings that I've been able to observe or lead conversations at or work in. And that, I think, is part of it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I think another part of it is... One of the things I wonder is are there enough experts inside of design teams that can also sort of speak to the experiences of facing online harassment? A lot of these teams are very white. They're very north American. I mean, there's so many things I'm trying to run through what all of them are. Some of it is, is there enough research or are they like regularly engaging with users? And I think in some cases they are, it's just that hasn't built up enough fluency inside of all the workers in these companies, right? So I'm a design researcher. I'm often working in the Internet Freedom and Human Rights Space. So for me, that's the fluency I have, is I'm only coming at it from people that have been harmed.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So I can be a real bummer if you will, inside of certain design scenarios, when it comes to ideating, what's a new thing to build? Because I'm always like \\\"That's going to harm someone. That's going to do this. That's a bad idea. Don't do that.\\\" And that's kind of the opposite of how Americans, especially Silicon Valley designers kind of operate. We're always operating from the ideal use case. And I'm operating from, \\\"What could possibly go wrong? Let's bring in threat modeling and security procedures sort of into this to affect design for us to design better.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So I think part of the big issue is design culture and how we build things. I think another issue is we aren't prioritizing human rights research and human rights education across all disciplines. I think another thing is we aren't, or designers or design teams aren't necessarily educating themselves on use cases, even going beyond personas of saying, \\\"This is a use case, we need to be actively threat modeling against these use cases.\\\" For example, requiring people to read Design Justice, and Silicon Values, and Mistrust, for example, would be helpful in an education for people onboarding or working in these companies. They also, I think, need more training, but more folding in actual threat modeling into their daily practices. I think that's like the first layer.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I'm so glad you brought Jillian York. We've actually recorded an interview with her about Silicon Values that's going to come out on the feed probably before our piece with you will come out. And the book is just so rich, but one of the things that I love about it is that it talks about this sort of value set that is affecting these tools. I feel like if we sat down to design new tools with the idea of \\\"How do we make sure that we harm as few people as possible?\\\" rather than \\\"How do we get this up to a billion users as fast as we possibly can?\\\" But I feel like everything in the economic system and the innovation system sort of mitigates against that. How are you as an artist, and a practitioner, and a writer, and a designer, instead of all the different things you are, how are you trying to get across that message that we need to think about harm as well as think about growth?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That's where I really try to reach designers. I try to teach classes in Silicon Values. So I taught one on Ethics and Human Rights and how it affects design. A lot of the writing I do or research I do is directly on how things like online harassment manifests into a design layer. I had just published a policy paper, actually a few days ago, with the German Marshall Fund on dark patterns and design culture. So one of the things I think that's really important to keep in mind in these conversations is it's all of these intersecting problems, and design culture is just one of them. And I think in that space, that's where I'm trying to sort of use my expertise as someone who's trained as a designer, who's worked in these areas, but also recognizing that product design and design like UX and UI is the layer or the thing that takes code and policy.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It makes it understandable and interactable for a user. So, for example, your security settings, you don't have to be a security engineer to understand how to use them. You don't have to open up a command line when even reporting something like privacy. You don't have to be a lawyer to try to understand or decipher how to report something. And that being something that doesn't mean that those two examples are great or the best design that they could be. But rather, design is taking something that is policy heavy, like the divisions of online harassment, like how a platform will try to understand that content and seeking the tech, where that content is going to go, and it's turning it into an understandable interface and flow for a user to report something. And so, thinking about the politics of design in terms of these spaces is really important because design is what can obfuscate, or elevate these issues.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, for me, that's kind of the space I try to really occupy in. So, when I hear a policy recommendation, one of the things I want to try to do is translate that into something for a designer. So that can be an op-ed, like the space of advocacy, like my Digital HKS Report. That was really me trying to replicate studies I thought were happening inside of social networks. How are social media companies trying to understand online harassment against journalists? Let's try to replicate one of those studies that will then manifest into design recommendations.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In other groups, after we published related things, which is so important, like Penn-America and the World Wide Web Foundation. And there really is a moment, I think, right here, for what I'm thinking of, is the seatbelt of online safety. What are things that we could start to standardize more? And again, a seatbelt is something that was designed,, was an open source and was then able to be sort of implemented across all cars. So how can we start to think of the security settings and security features in a similar way inside of software? \", \"[crosstalk 00:12:53]\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The seatbelt's a wonderful analogy, right? Because while we think of the seatbelt is this wonderful move towards safety culture, it was also sort of introduced as a way to fend off a much more expensive safety events, which was the airbag, which had also been invented, but was going to be so much more expensive to implement. So, design really is where the rubber meets the road in quite a literal sense, even including things like those questions of constraint. What can we afford to do? What can we not afford to do? I'm super fascinated where some of your recent research has gone. I would say, in some ways, sort of deeper into the heart of the machine, then the design layer, with things like your Feminist Dataset Project, where I understand that project as looking at gender biases throughout sort the lifestyle of a machine learning system. And you make this great analogy and introducing it to this project focused on toasters. Can you tell us about toasters and then tell us about The Feminist Dataset?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. So, pedagogically, The Feminist Dataset is inspired by The Critical Design Project, by Thomas Thwaites, it's called The Toaster Project. So Thwaites builds a commercial toaster from scratch, from digging up iron ore out of his backyard to smelting it, to creating his own plastic. And at the very end, he creates this technically working toaster. Should you use it to cook? Don't think that maybe you should. But it was... It's really kind of misshapen and beautifully. And it is like a comic kind of on this sort of ubiquitous thing, a toaster that you can go into a corner shop and buy for 15 or $20. There are so many of them, and he was really interested in the concept of how do you take that ubiquitous hardware and really unpack it. And so I'm very much inspired by that process, but with software.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So how do you carefully consider and remake every angle and part of the machine learning pipeline from start to finish, but with intersectional feminist values? So it's not just data collection, it's not just the kind of data, it's how do you train it? How do you clean it? How do you label it? What's the act within that that would be feminist? What's the platform you're using? How would you create a feminist audit? And then also, what is the kind of algorithm we should use? And part of the point of the project is also trying to engage with failure in a way. My project will not be truly intersectionally feminist. I'm a cis white lady, for example. But also, it's like, can software ever truly be feminist? Is kind of a question. And I'm interested in the trade-offs people make. And so for me, I'm the experiment, what's the trade off I'm going to make? And I'm going to have to justify that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I mean, it's interesting, as we talk about machine learning, as we talk about AI, everyone wants to talk about harm. Is harm the right way to think about this? Do we think about women being mislabeled or misconstrued or stereotyped? I mean, should we talk about what are the harms that come out of a machine learning system that is not a feminist system, or is there a better paradigm than harm when we start interrogating things like machine learning systems?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I mean, I think harm is a good one. It's also abroad. And so I think, whose definition of harm, who's being harmed always has to be asked, right? Because if you were to give all the best intentions to a first-year design student, who is, let's say, white from a small town, and you're like, \\\"Make sure it doesn't harm.\\\" They're going to have a very, very different perspective than per se, like \", \"[inaudible 00:16:57]\", \" thinking of harm, right? So I think this is where having standards or examples is really helpful. And so the project itself, from this dataset, is intersectional, but it's also very much trying to recognize that harm comes from all of these different angles. I think often when we talk about machine learning, we do focus on the data that goes in, the sort of connections, or inferences, or predictions, or simulations, and algorithms making any output.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I think for me, I'm interested in those things, but I also think harm can manifest in so many more ways. And, for example, even if you're making something equitably or rather if the output is equitable, what if the process of building it was not equitable? What if that's the problem? And so then using the framework of intersectional feminism, I actually have to address that because at a certain point, I'm going to have to hire someone to help me, or hire a series of people, or have a series of people help me do the cleaning or the training. So I have to actually think through, well, what is an equitable work environment to engage with people and that would then be feminist? And I think that that's also really important, because all the different steps and choices we make, all have trade-offs.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And if we're just only focusing on the outputs of artificial intelligence and not the actual structure of building and making, and not all of these other invisible areas that feed into it, like, \\\"Can we ever truly fix it?\\\" Right? Or can we ever truly try to course correct or try to improve it? That's why I think it's been really important to see all, for the past few years, so many conversations around Mechanical Turk, for example, and recognizing that that is a part of this sort of invisible nature of machine learning. I think that there are other things to also sort of think about within that, but that's what the project is really trying to unpack, is it's like if I were building the toaster, every small screw I'm using, I really have to think about, \\\"Where did this come from?\\\" \\\"Who made it?\\\" \\\"How did I get it?\\\" \\\"Where did I get it from?\\\" And I'm doing that effectively with software.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So I'd love to drill in a little bit on that Mechanical Turk question, right? So, one of the big things that comes into play with machine learning systems is that what they're really doing is they're extrapolating from training data. So to use an example from the wonderful television show, Silicon Valley, we can look at a set of images and say, \\\"Is this a hot dog?\\\", \\\"Is this not a hot dog?\\\" One of the more popular ways to do the 'is a hot dog is not a hot dog', is to hire people on Mechanical Turk and ask them to code images as 'hot dog', 'not hot dog'. You dug into the ethics instead of the implications of this in a project for Mozilla. Can I get you to talk about that piece?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, sure. That's TRK, technically responsible knowledge. I designed and researched that and then built it with \", \"[inaudible 00:20:05]\", \". And then the graphic design from Rainbow Unicorn for a fellowship I had with The Mozilla Foundation. And I was really interested in what was like an accessible browser-based tool people could use in lieu of Mechanical Turk. I couldn't find enough data on something like CrowdFlower to actually ensure that it had feminist values. During this project I became a Mechanical Turk myself, just to get a sense of what the interfaces felt like, what the experience was. And within this project, we started thinking a lot about just money and cost. And so this project I should highlight, it does a few things and it does a few things. One because it is a that I made for a fellowship.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And then two, this is one of the trade-offs that will have to be documented for The Eventual Feminist Dataset, a book that I will write at some point, which is... There are just things we can't do for this. There's an edge where the art project is, and a startup would begin, for example. And that's just sort of the reality of the kind of internet we live on. So, Feminist Dataset, TRK is a part of Feminist Dataset, and it is an open source browser-based tool. Anyone can use the code. So if any of your students wants to use it or run an experiment, it's on GitHub, please use it. You can upload datasets to be labeled and cleaned, or you can also be the one cleaning them. And if you're uploading it for people, you have to actually provide a lot of context around it, like what you're using or what the images are, why.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And almost like a warning label or a trigger warning.

And then you're invited to reject it or accept it once you get into the interface. And then, it just asks for some information about you. And then that's injected plain textile into the dataset, inspired by data sheets for datasets. And that's like a part of research work I was doing a little bit around the same time was thinking of why don't we have data ingredients? Why don't we have standardized labels?

How long are these tasks?\\\" It's only going like task and price, but time is a really big important variable in terms of if something is priced equitably or not.

Also, when we were playing with the time element, the New York Times did an article and they even created a little experiments. We started using that to see how long it really takes to do these things. And then, we started doing all this math around what is a living wage?

So we're like, \\\"Okay, we need a minus five minutes from every hour, right, to then start to figure out how many worked hours is someone working to cover all this pay.\\\" We also took, I think, a 45-minute lunch break, and then another break.

And so the provocation I give students when I lecture on this or I host workshops is instead of designing an encyclopedia, what if we're designing a paper zine? What if something is allowed to organically decay? What if it's not designed to last forever? Then how does that change our relationship to software? , for example, or how has that changed our relationship to permanence? How has that changed our relationship to communities?

I think it's designing from the very beginning or thinking through features, people would want, how people would want to talk to each other, then how do you ensure or foster that kind of engagement, and how do you, again, offer different kinds of safety protocols? But then the big thing is, often, if you're starting something... I recently did this as a workshop in France. The thing I would tell, I think I would tell students is like, \\\"Well, you're also responsible for people's safety. If it's your software and they're coming something you've built, you are actually responsible for people.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Caroline Sinders:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So you need to ensure that not only do you have a code of conduct that, you know how to implement a code of conduct online.

How have you determined that?\\\" And you can just see like the students' heads to sort of start to explode a little bit. And all these things are thoughtful and intentional. They're things you have to do. They cannot be after thoughts.

It looks at black-led protests between 1960 and 1972, and if I've got it right, the basic discovery is that nonviolent protests appear to have led to sympathetic media coverage and that appears to have led to Democratic victories at the polls.

I would say to the first part of your question about the timing of this paper, I am standing on the shoulders of many giants, including some of your own work that shows protests are influencing media. And in particular, I'm standing on the shoulders of the activists who figured these insights out in the '50s and '60s. There are folks who are very strategically using the media to amplify their own voices throughout the mid-20th century as a way to essentially use moral capital to advance their own agendas.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In some ways, I think maybe the first thing I would say is that I think part of what I tried to do with this paper is really to listen to what activists were saying and doing so that I could see the world through their eyes.

There's a lot of work that looked at understanding the growth of the Civil Rights Movement. There was much less work on thinking about how that mapped to elections. It's clearly these are things that have been studied historically and there's a lot of sociological work, but in political science protests were a little bit at the margins of the field. So there's a field of contentious politics, but often these are things...\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I mean, the other thing that I think I should speak to a little bit is that a lot of these things are thought of as issues that happen outside of the United States.

So there's a little bit of disciplinary boundaries that aren't very interesting and a little bit of...\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"All of which is to say that, to come back to the final question you asked, what brought me to this work, in some ways I think of myself as a child of the Civil Rights Movement.

I came of age wondering how is it we went from the victories of the mid-60s to the moment I came of age when the dominant political rhetoric was around law and order and tough on crime. I was growing up in New York at the time and it was a period where just law and order was the dominant politic of the day.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So I was trying to understand that arc and that took me to looking at things like public opinion between the 1950s and the 2000s. What you see is a pattern that really links what's happening on the ground, what protesters are doing on the ground to, as you said, media coverage and then public opinion, which influences politics. Some of what allowed this paper to I think do work that was just, again contributing to a longer conversation was to try and link a bunch of different pieces where people had shown elements of it, protests maybe are influencing media, but less protests influencing media, influencing politics, and that they're differential effects when we see nonviolent and violent protests.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of the things that I love about this paper is the rigor of it.

Why are we talking about rainfall?

That's not a particularly provocative claim. I even looking through historical newspaper archives find articles where it's like, Rainfall dampens protest turnout. I mean that's the headline.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So we see it both historically and just intuitively, and in other research there's evidence that again rainfall is depressing gatherings. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Okay. What's beautiful about rainfall is that we can treat rainfall as a mechanism of random assignment. Some cities have rainfall. If there's rainfall, there's likely to be a protest. Some cities don't have rainfall. If they don't, there's more likely to be a protest.

Detroit, y'all are going to be peaceful.\\\" Obviously, we can't do that, but weirdly enough, rainfall actually sort of does that. It suppresses protests in some places and it enables protests in other places.

What I find is that the...\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's one other detail in this, which is that in April of 1968 Martin Luther King is tragically assassinated, and there are 137 protests that escalate to violence in the week following his assassination. What I look at is not just rainfall generally but rainfall in a very specific time period, and I find that rainfall before King's assassination doesn't predict voting in November. Rainfall later in April doesn't predict voting in November, but rainfall in the week following King's assassination predicts a shift away from the Democratic Party. Because there's no really plausible story for why rainfall in one week in April is predicting voting in November but not other weeks, I make the claim that we can say protests that escalate to violence cause white voters to shift to the Republican coalition.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"To be clear, there's lots else going on, right?

And for other people, they're like, \\\"A man was murdered. This is not the time to talk about how the Democratic Party does. That's not what this is about.\\\" I think that's one lesson for me is to just think about in certain contexts one needs to have a deep regard for what's the emotional resonant feeling people have. Is there room to even talk about the statistical effects or the political consequences? That's one thing and I just think that's in general going to be a challenge for social scientists in a moment that's deeply emotional.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's one other thing, though, which I'm less sympathetic to, which is a kind of reverence for a radical politic that says, if we agree with the cause or we agree with the motivations, we can be deeply sympathetic to people's anger over the murder of George Floyd. That in some ways any criticism of what's happening on the ground is off limits. That's also what I think some of the buzzsaw that David Shor walked into and me as well is that there's just a sense of to raise any kind of question about this set of ideas or set of issues that we think are a just cause can still lead to... Just because it's a just cause doesn't mean that every action on behalf of that cause is just. Just because something is a just cause doesn't mean we also shouldn't ask what's strategic, what's going to help advance this.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think some of what I observe in the blowback is a sense of we can't even ask strategic or practical questions about things which we have a certain kind of reverent idealism about.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And this actually feels like a moment where asking strategic questions is really critical. Because, first of all, we know that the great leaders of the Civil Rights Movement were acutely aware of how things played in the press. They were very, very interested in these things. I remember visiting Medgar Evers's home where he was assassinated, which has been left essentially unchanged and as a shrine. The thing that most stuck with me were the piles of Life magazines. He was very literally watching to see how the movement that was so central to his life was playing out.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But of course, right now we have far greater ability to document, to share and to try to shape coverage of media coming through social media.

One part which, again, your work gets at is that part of what's exciting about this moment is that someone like Medgar Evers needed the Life photographer to show up. People like John Lewis needed ABC to show up with heavy cameras and there was a lot of work. I mean just underlining your point about the degree to which this was done with real intention, people were organizing protests in the morning so footage could make it to broadcast nationally out of New York in the evening.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"They were casting children as the front of a protest so that the photos would be particularly sympathetic. They were doing all kinds of things. They were picking cities so that they knew that these were... It's not an accident that Bull Connor was a subject of protest activity. He was selected as a target because it was expected he was going to be brutal as a police chief. All of which is to say there was real intention in a kind of... Both people like John Lewis and Martin Luther King say that this was trying to dramatize injustice, so you were trying to essentially construct highly theatrical protest moments that would be captured by the media and essentially shame the South and America more generally into action.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What's both exciting and I think speaks to some of the possibility of these technologies now is that you don't need ABC to do that dramatizing injustice. Darnella Frazier, now famously Pulitzer Prize winning teenager, at the time shows up and has the presence of mind to bear witness and document the murder of George Floyd and do it in a way that paid real attention to... This is a little bit of a tangent but to doing the camerawork so that we can see his face and we can hear him cry. That really matters and that simply with her phone and distributing that video on Facebook, she transforms American politics.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We don't need big media companies in the way that we did before. And to be clear, the Frazier video is an echo of the video that was shot by the gentleman who documents the beating of Rodney King. So there's a way in which the democratization of certain technologies, a big video camera of the '80s or early '90s, rather, in the King case is still a kind of democratization of technology and that just is a through line straight through to Darnella Frazier and the current moment.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That said, these technologies, I think it's still unclear to what degree these are going to be fundamentally pro-democratic forces in this moment where we're also seeing these things used for lots of more authoritarian purposes as well.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. There's no guarantee that this combination of increased access to technology, increased access to these networks means that justice wins out, right?

There's no guarantee that it works out, but I do think that understanding the ways in which we can document and mobilize at this particular moment in the same way that Medgar Evers and others were so sensitive to that question of where, who, how do we frame this, there's now really conversations going on around this.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Is this paper in a sense advocacy for nonviolent protest?

It's called The Phoenix Effect of State Violence. I'm getting the name a little bit wrong, but it looks at Jewish resistance to the Third Reich during the Holocaust.

This is the idea of Agenda Seeding, to seed your issues into that media and use the media as your weapon. In that case, nonviolence has a really powerful capacity to give people who are despised an upper hand, people who are statistical minorities the voice of some of the most elite, most powerful figures in society. I mean, I don't know that that comes through, but what I was trying to say is violence may be justifiable, but it's not always necessarily the tactic that's the most effective tactic.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Of course, what's fascinating about this is at the heart of this paper is this question of asymmetric power in a democracy, right?

If we are democratically setting the media agenda, it's unlikely that the rights of African-Americans are going to make it to the top.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"You're talking about this idea that there may be cases if we have an institution that is doing its job, it's actually amplifying concerns and, frankly, if we trust it, right? At the end of the day, there's a certain trust of Life magazine.

They're going to receive that message and try to do something about it.\\\" And then second of all, we understand these dynamics that we if we are protesting in a vacuum, we don't have that possibility of influencing public opinion.

I think that's spot on, and I think I'm going to underline one thing you said earlier, which was that in the 1960s it's important to appreciate that there's three kinds of media in the country. There's a pro-segregation, essentially newspapers in the South, newspapers, radio, a little bit of television. There's a national media, in particular TV, that's sort of indifferent to the concerns of African-Americans. Then there's a black press. So the black press is paying attention to black interests, but NBC was not unless African-Americans were forcing those issues to the front page.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I would add one other detail, which is that even when the press is trusted and relatively attentive and somewhat independent, what some of the activists of the 1960s figured was that if we have a protest and everything goes relatively peacefully, some people are arrested, that can look to a relatively indifferent larger white America as the system working as it should. You have the right to engage in civil disobedience. You go to court. That's how America's supposed to work, so we don't need to do anything. What really forced the hand of the country was these incidents that looked extreme. So it's when nonviolent protesters are met with a brutal, repressive state that the larger conscience of the country is shocked.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That really became the core strategy is how to shock the conscience of the country, and that's hard because it means in the first case just potentially risking injury, trauma, death as protesters. And then it's really hard to sustain nationally because your kinfolk are watching people they empathize with deeply getting harmed, and for a lot of people it's hard to sustain turn the other cheek indefinitely. At some point an eye for an eye becomes a kind of just logic. I think the kinds of tactics that were so successful in the 1960s also have embedded in them an element of their own undoing because it's an exceedingly difficult tactic to sustain indefinitely.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, it is possible to have some effect with large nonviolent protests that generate media, like the March on Washington, but even very big events are hard to produce. It's a tactic that can work, engaging in tactics that produce repression or producing very large events that get attention, but neither are easy.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Let's bring it in for a landing. We talked about two, I think, really big ideas here. The first one is this idea that even within networked environments where it seems like networks are more valuable the bigger they are, there's a subset of networks. There's niche communities where the value may actually come from being focused, from being highly knowledgeable, from being supportive, from being a community where you can be your authentic self.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We've talked about this idea that protest, its documentation can shift media coverage, can shift mood, can shift voting behavior in a way that's clearly demonstrable. You and I, I think, are both fascinated by the change in the media ecosystem, the change in the social media landscape. Knit the two together somewhat for me. As we're thinking about this new wave of racial justice movements, was we're thinking about structural racism in the United States and finally confronting some of these demons that we've been living with for hundreds of years, how do you find yourself thinking about this new media environment where it really isn't the 1960s?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We have a highly partisan media. We have a social media that is both very open but also controlled by a very limited environment. How do you find yourself both as a scholar and an activist trying to navigate the confluence of these two ideas?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Omar Wasow\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Great big, rich question. Let me pick one small part to begin, and that is that going back to your question before about what are some of the lessons of the Agenda Seeding paper, I think one for me is that activists in some ways should try to think like a camera. That there's just something very powerful about how media will amplify what's happening on the ground, and that can work for you and against you. I was watching coverage in the early Floyd protests of there's a Starbucks in LA that was getting vandalized, and CNN sat on that for 10 minutes. That takes the focus away from a concern about state violence against, in particular, unarmed African-American men. We want to keep the focus on the core injustice.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Thinking like a camera can mean a couple of things. One, it can mean in the case of again someone like Darnella Frazier, having the presence of mind to bear witness with your cellphone camera, but it can also mean organizing events that are camera friendly. So in Denver, there was a die-in and there were just these very powerful images of, I don't know the number, but hundreds of young people in particular laying on the ground. That's an image that should make the front page of a paper, definitely made the evening news.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Then the third way I think thinking like a camera can matter is just there are moments where somebody might in their rage, in their anger want to, I don't know, spray paint a wall or throw a brick through a window. And again, we might empathize with the level of anger or rage people have, but that individual can also say, \\\"Well, how is this... \\\" We used to joke in the early days of the internet, \\\"Don't send an email that you wouldn't want to end up on the front page of The New York Times.\\\" I think there's kind of an echo of that in this idea about what are the kinds of tactics that can be very effective and those tactics will end up, particularly if they are dramatic, in the news, but the burning car may not focus our attention on the issue of injustice.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"At the same time, I think it's also important to note just as we're adjudicating a little between violence and nonviolence that violence absolutely captures the media's attention. A burning car will be an image in a newspaper account, and so it's not that violence can't... Media covers plane crashes, not plane landings, going back to the metaphor I used a moment ago. So violence is a very powerful way of drawing in the media, but if the focus of the camera is not on injustice, then I would say the evidence historically is that that will pull away from the larger cause. That's one core idea, so this idea of just thinking like a camera, thinking like how the media might make sense of this.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The other part of your question was thinking about what does this mean in terms of the media ecosystem today and these technologies. There I think we're in this transitional moment, and I think it's very hard to know exactly how this is going to play out. On the one hand, there is this more partisan media and I think that matters a lot. At the same time in the South in the '60s there was pro-segregation media, so I'm not so sure that-\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"How different it really is.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Omar Wasow\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. Let me try to come back to some kind of clear takeaways. I think there is an opportunity. What we saw over the last year and a half is that certain kinds of narratives can punch through. So we saw there were police forces that criticized what happened in Minneapolis. You almost never see police forces criticize each other. There were conservative commentators who said what Officer Chauvin did was beyond the pale. So I think there is still fundamentally a capacity for capturing a moral high ground, for certain kinds of stories to capture the national attention and to move public opinion in ways that are consistent with what activists concerned about state violence might want people to be focusing on. I think that kind of core pattern was true in the '60s. It's true now.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think we see evidence of the steady drip, drip, drip of these videos, as disheartening and depressing as they can be and in some cases I can't even watch them because it's too emotionally hard, is public opinion, particularly among young people, is shifting. So there's a sense that discrimination against African-Americans is an issue has become more supported as a position. That the police might discriminate against African-Americans has increased in support.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think that we do see broad shifts in public opinion, again, consistent with patterns in the past. And I think the cellphone camera footage really is powerful in its capacity to allow people to walk in the shoes of folks who they had never walked in before. It's not, just to be clear, African-Americans. We see this on other issues as well around the world.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But there are movements and counter-movements, and it's not clear to me that the ways in which these technologies can be mobilized by conspiracy theorists and disinformation actors and authoritarian states and movements, I'm not sure in the contest between these pro-democratic aspects of the technology and these anti-democratic aspects of the technology which will carry the day. That's I think for me one of the big ongoing puzzles.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's a way in which your work and mine has generally celebrated these democratizing aspects. I mean a service like Tripod was giving everybody a printing press. That's kind of magical.

And you're exactly right that part of the fascination with the internet was that it was this disembodied space and by extension, therefore, somehow identity free. So there was for potential investors and some people in the media a real puzzle of like, why launch a black online community? I think what helped people understand was one way of thinking about how pluralism might work on the internet, and by that I mean we pitched BlackPlanet as a kind of base camp for people.

We worked together at the Berkman Klein center at Harvard, we've coauthored papers and book chapters together. So we are long-time friends and collaborators, but Jill, part of what was so exciting about this book for me is that it's really the story of a journey that you've been on for the last 10 years or so, really longer than that, maybe closer to 20, as an advocate for freedom of expression.

You've got US values, which tend to dominate the world based on the first amendment in particular, when it comes to speech, you've got universal human rights based values, which a lot of the world adheres to, and then you've got Silicon values, which are the very particular ideologies of a select few really privileged individuals.

They don't weigh harm in, in kind of, you know, trying to assess what should or should not be allowed on the platform or where they should guide individuals. And they're very, very prudish when it comes down to it.

And I, the example I remember in particular, I don't remember if I included it in the book or not, was that a Kenyan police chief had spoken on the record about the importance of Al-Shabaab being able to use Twitter because it helped them to track it, to track their movements.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Jillian C.

And so, you know, I mean, I, there's a lot of expertise here that I don't know as well as some of the folks I quoted, Lisa Stent Mitski, I rely on her a lot for this and her excellent book on the politicization of the term, but basically the U S list goes far overboard in my opinion, and includes in a number of cases, groups, which are state actors or semi-state actors, and has billows the easiest example for me to talk about, because I know Lebanon very well.

I wasn't allowed to be nude, but like, let me tell you, like in the, you know, after parties and stuff, we were all just getting naked, going swimming, things like that. And so I was raised with this, not in a very American way, but in a, I guess, a very sort of Northeast new England hippie kind of way. And so my comfort with the human body is essential to my views on free expression.

Folks who've had mastectomies, folks who are trans folks who are non binary, et cetera. And for them, a lot of this is absolutely vital expression. It's also vital expression for a lot of women who, for whatever reason, choose to use their body in their art, in their making a living, et cetera, including sex workers. So that's a huge part of it. But then another part of it that really just kind of gets me is the idea that women's bodies are sacred and sexual at the same time. And so we can't show the women's nipple. Now what even is a woman's nipple on the one hand,\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Jillian C.

So I used to use this as an example of how automation works, because I'll just explain this quickly, automation is, it's easier when you're talking about something that's easily classifiable. And Dave Willner's quoted in the book about this. He's one of Facebook's early architects, but imagine you've got a ball now you've got a ball and then you've got a square. Those are that's easily binary it's classifiable. And that's how Facebook and many other companies treat nipples. They say, okay, this is women's nipples. This is men's nipples or whatever. And that's kind of the problem is because number one, if we believe that gender exists on a spectrum and I very much do, then you've got a problem in kind of identifying what's a woman in the first place.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Jillian C.

I was so happy to have found her and, you know, she documents her transition. And at what point, Instagram decided that she was a woman. And so when I talked to the companies about it, it's always hard to get a straight answer. Sometimes they blame it on their conservative audiences, but the, the quote that I got in the book, and this was kind of amazing because it was just a casual conversation with somebody who had one foot out the door. She just said very plainly. The reason that Facebook bans nipples is because your feed would be a bunch of nipples all the time.

But number two, if you've got all this automation technology, why not just allow me to be the one to flip the switch instead of you deciding for me what's acceptable. And that's really what it comes down to. That and the fact that, you know, I, unlike Facebook, I don't inherently believe that political expression is more important than cultural expression. Whether, again, whether we're talking about sexual health, sex work or just, I want to be topless on my feed. Why can't I do that?

And what really struck me was how, you know, Alexander Hamilton was so key to the creation of, American law, of American ideology. And yet what took him down was the sex scandal. And that was fascinating to me. I didn't know that history, you know, I can tell you that we don't learn much in a public school in the US, or at least not where I was, but I didn't know any of that history.

And I think that that's what really, really bothered me. And that kind of was where I ended up, it was Hamilton that kind of pulled all these ideas together for me. And so, yeah, I mean, I, you know, I got asked a couple of weeks ago, what, I think I mentioned this in the book that if, if Facebook had been built in Germany, it would be very different. And I got asked how, and, you know, I mean, I'll be Frank about this, that German culture is much more accepting of sexuality, nudity, all of that expression.

All of it's really dependent on the society where, you know, where were certain values were shaped, certain ideologies were created. And yet, you know, I think that having these platforms be so US centric is I think that US ideology is, is much more an anomaly in the world.

Because this is totally prevalent with, old generations, but particularly with older generations. Is that because there hasn't been this, they haven't really had a proper conversations around sex.

And really the reason I wanted to bring you here, we have a conversation on the show about imagining the internet as it could be and should be. When we imagine that we're often thinking in terms of technological changes and affordances, but somewhere we absolutely have to imagine to the internet is an internet that is not just inclusive of black and brown voices, but is an internet co-created and filled with spaces built by black net users.

And often I like to begin by talking about a chapter that I had early on in the book, or at least a title that ultimately it didn't make it in, but the early draft title of it was, Remember When the Internet Was Black?. And it was sort of both question and statement that A, what would it be like to think about an internet that was black? And B, there was actually the time when blackness, black culture, black cultural production was really at the core and center. And so, I like to talk about that particular moment that it was demonstrated in many ways, AfroNet is a great place to start. Here, you have... For the folks that remember the early days of bulletin boards and so forth, this was the network that was created in that BBS system.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It was carefully curated. It was black only. And so, system operators who would connect black populations from East Coast to West Coast, stretched on up into Canada. And so, the AfroNet was this group of people who came together really to just have community. It was interesting when I would talk to folks members of AfroNet, and asked them about what was this moment like? Why was this moment called into being? And I sort of had a very political lens on it, but most of them didn't have that. It was simply, \\\"Here was a way for me to connect with other people like me across the country.\\\" And that might just be for very \", \"[inaudible 00:03:24]\", \", everyday interactions or gossip or what have you, or something that might be more political, but the impetus was simply connecting with other black folks.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's a lot of cyber-utopian rhetoric about that moment of the net, right? We've got folks like Howard Rheingold singing the praises of The Well, which is in that Bulletin Board System moment. I think a lot of the white imagination of that moment is of the emergent net as a space without race, a space without class, you can be whoever you want. What's so important about making sure that there are black spaces online?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Charlton McIlwain:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. I think a lot of this is about A, a very long history of exclusion. And so, black folks wanting to say, \\\"Look, there is room and certainly buy-in into this utopian vision of race not mattering in certain ways, but not in all ways,\\\" and sort of embracing this need that, \\\"Look, we have grown up in a society that has historically excluded us, has barred us from entry into certain spaces.\\\" And a by-product of that is the need and desire to create spaces of our own. And I think that that became a necessity both as a retreat, but also as a way of protection in a wider culture, even an internet culture that is certainly well beyond blackness and black folks.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, I think that need for a community, for spaces that were produced by us and for us, or the reverse for us, by us as the adage and commercial appeal in the early nineties. That was necessary, and so not only to have a sense of being represented, but to know somewhere, whether it's physically, virtually, what have you, I have a place to go where being who I am is not questioned, talking about the things that I want to talk about is not questioned, taken at a given, my value as a person, as a group of people are taken as a first principle and agreed upon.

We were both in college in the late eighties, early nineties. A lot of the debates that I remember from my college years were about creating those sorts of spaces. Beverly Tatum ended up publishing a book, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And it's a book that ends up being really revelatory about that incredible importance of having spaces where you don't have to explain aspects of your identity, where you're allowed to be who you are, and particularly on the internet, which so often sort of refuses to acknowledge race and to acknowledge difference of experience.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think the importance of those spaces can't be overstated. The other day, I was teaching an early Danah Boyd paper on definitions of social networks, and she's listing social networks that are starting to emerge in the early 2000s. There are a wave of networks that are based around identity in one fashion or another, including of course, black \", \"[inaudible 00:07:21]\", \", which I know that you've written about. What happens in that moment, and how do we lose that moment? Why have those communities been subsumed into Twitter and Facebook?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Charlton McIlwain:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, wow, it's a big question. And starting with the fact that as you said, these types of networks really proliferated on the early internet, and survived for quite a while and then a fairly abrupt ending. Number one, I think that they existed because they were part of what came before, meaning like in the cases of your AfroNets of the world and so forth, when folks were trying to think about how do we profit in this new kind of space, this new venture online? I think a lot of people smartly looked back and said, \\\"Well, we want to replicate these kinds of communities in this new space.\\\" And they look back to your AfroNets of the world to say, \\\"Hey, can you reproduce that in this online forum?\\\" And so, you look at your AfroNet, you look at one proposed venture that was GO AFRO by CompuServe in the early mid-nineties to compete with NetNoir which was AOL's version and product that grew up with Malcolm CasSelle and David Ellington. Black Voices was another one that followed closely on with that very, very profitable.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, all of those, I think were seen as, \\\"Hey, here's a way of creating value in this new space, which is simply bringing people together, and people coming together around what are clear similarities, clear points of contact.\\\" And so, I think in those early days, you could see really the value of that at the relatively small scale that they appeared. And then I think in a lot of ways, I think the internet just got big and more complicated, and its structure grew such that those kinds of networks no longer flourished, and people were not seeing and investing in them as very viable places to produce and to make money from. And so, then it became, \\\"Let's reproduce these within a larger framework that we know is possible and profitable,\\\" so your Facebook, your Twitter, your Myspaces, et cetera, where folks can have their own communities within this larger umbrella.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It is fascinating to think about these mega corporations with CompuServe and AOL being willing to sort of say, \\\"Yeah, we should have a dedicated black space. We should have an Afrocentric space.\\\" But of course, once we get to Facebook, the message is, \\\"No, this is for everybody. Your space is our space.\\\" And it is not to say that there are not black spaces on Facebook, but that Facebook's identity tries to sort of trump all the rest of those. Can we talk about the special case of Twitter. Black Twitter has emerged as a political and social phenomenon. Do you see lines going back through AfroNet, and that early nineties period into Black Twitter? Is this really different phenomenon that emerged?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Charlton McIlwain:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"No, I really see as a straight line between AfroNet, between the early Usenet groups where black folks would congregate and really connect and battle it out. You see the same kind of language conventions use, you see the same kinds of interactions when you look at an AfroNet chat and look at Twitter today. You see a lot of the short form, the playful nature in which people are engaging and interacting, and you see the way in which race and blackness is front-loaded in those interactions, and assumptions made about who that collective is, and who understands the tropes and so forth that are being bandied about. And what the calling card in some way is, as well as recognizing the wide variety and diversity within black culture, and in a lot of ways, taking those things to task and those kinds of conversations.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, the only thing for me when you think about Black Twitter and AfroNet, or \", \"[inaudible 00:12:24]\", \", I think it was on Usenet is really some additional affordances of a Twitter platform, but it's really the same basic thing. It's where do we find our people in this particular space and then do what we do.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And some of the blurry edges, right? I think for many of us who are lucky enough to have colleagues who are participating in Black Twitter, we end up at least being aware of some of those discussions, even if not always participating within them. Is there something that gets lost when Black Twitter as a space, but it's not an exclusively African American space, it's a cultural space interacting with those other Twitter spaces.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Charlton McIlwain:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. I think there is a little bit lost. Number one, just because it's always open for some kind of intervention, if you will by \\\"outsiders.\\\" You don't have that sense of authenticity, and when I say authenticity, I mean that sort of very broadly, meaning you just have racist folks who are able to enter into a conversation, either fully aware or putting themselves and who they are out there, or posing as it were, and acting like through their interactions that they are a member of the community, but are not there in the same way that other people in good faith participate in that community.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, I think that those are some of the downsides. I do think that people more and more are aware of other ears, other eyes that are part of that, and therefore, you don't quite see the level of frankness and explicitness that you might in a place that you know is much more relatively closed. And there's a way I speak to my friends and the way I speak to friends of friends who I know have some proximity to myself and my ideals and so forth, that I simply don't with a broader community of folks who I know might judge in varying ways what I'm saying. And so, I think that's the limitation of a platform like Twitter that provides the affordances that it does, and all the folks that get joy and many, many positive things for participating. There are those downsides.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Sure. And the openness to harassment, the openness to abuse. We're seeing a lot of this right now with Dr. Timnit Gebru and sort of backlash to Google's real scandalous firing of her, and some of the things that she's absorbing in these spaces. For me, it makes me wonder whether we don't need a return to some of these spaces that maybe had firmer boundaries and its stronger control about sort of who gets to be in and who gets to be out. Let me ask you a question on Twitter and activism. You're co-author along with some brilliant scholars like Deen Freelon of some of the best research out there on the relationship between social media and movements like Black Lives Matter, how critical are these black spaces and social media for that organizing effort?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Charlton McIlwain:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, I think they're very critical. And if, for no other reason around the two things that I think social media is really set up to do, which is about volume and visibility, right? So, as we all know, movements need and thrive on attention, and it so happens that that's what these platforms are really designed to provide in many ways. So, I think it's absolutely crucial. It is interesting. I got into a lot of discussions early on in doing research for the book and talking to a lot of Black Lives Matter activists and so forth who were very... I sort of throw in this, tell me about this kind of digital movement of Black Lives Matter. And it was initial strong knee-jerk reaction to say, \\\"Hey, this is not about the internet. It's not about the digital. This is about organizing. This is about building capacity of folks to do various kinds of work.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I would keep sort of going back and saying, \\\"Yeah, but you couldn't have done this. You couldn't have done what Black Lives Matter accomplished even five years ago, much less 10 or beyond where the media environment was extremely different.\\\" And so, I think what was absolutely the game changer about Black Lives Matter was having spaces that allowed them to amplify the message. And that is what I think you see, and what has paid off, which is millions of people who know what Black Lives Matter is knows what it stands for, and that it did something that hasn't been done in basically about 50 years, which is to roust these issues back up to the top of the public agenda in ways that they haven't been for half a century.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"No, it's an extraordinary movement. I think it's a movement that in many cases is still underappreciated even with the level of attention it's gotten. You may have seen this new paper by Travis Campbell coming from UMass Amherst, where he's able to demonstrate a 15% to 20% decrease in police homicides in communities that had strong BLM movements. For me, it intersects with some of the work that we did over at MIT, where we were able to demonstrate that media attention to unarmed deaths, deaths of unarmed black people at the hands of the police gain massively more attention after Black Lives Matter sort of comes onto the media narrative. I think understanding protest in terms of channeling attention and channeling media narrative is something that we're not always very good at sort of recognizing the power around it, but is something that BLM has really drawn forward for all of us.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Charlton McIlwain:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, definitely. And I think where we often go awry is that we don't have the ability as you were sort of mentioning with this paper putting those two things together, meaning as soon as the visibility drops on Twitter, we go, \\\"Oh, it's must be over. There's nothing going on.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What did that do?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Charlton McIlwain:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah.

And the answer is always well, go down to your local courthouse, go down to your local city council. That's where the fight comes from. And I think that's really what the activists that I was talking to and about earlier were really referring to, that the groundswell of the work is on the ground in these very local contexts, but the two things go together, they're able to do that work because of the attention first driven to the issue and the sustainment of that attention.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"You document the stories of so many people who are doing such creative stuff in the nineties, through the early 2000s. As you point out, there's this moment where the emerging internet culture sees the value of not only celebrating black culture for black audiences, but celebrating it more broadly. But I think in many cases, when we think of Silicon Valley, we think of white dudes almost exclusively. And so, do a little bit of the where are they now?

I would say almost two or one they're all out of that game, per se. Some that are still like David Ellington and Malcolm CasSelle who at least up until his recent, unfortunately unfortunate passing were still entrepreneurs. Malcolm still very much in the digital internet realm in terms of New Ventures that he started, launched, et cetera. So, a few have remained successful in that space in different ways, but typically not in the same way that they started out, meaning with very focused black cultural related ventures. Really the rest to sort of faded out and most have very strong ideas about why that was the case. And most will simply say, \\\"Look, the capital dried up.\\\" And by dried up, we mean people did not look for us nor were we given an opportunity really to push our ideas, the technological innovations that we were doing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I remember one of the guys that I talk about a lot in the book, Ken Granderson who went to MIT and ended up living in Boston for most of his career, starting an early internet business that had both a profit side and building software and software products, but also a public interest side, if you will in helping sort of galvanize black folks and black communities in the Boston area around the internet. But he tells I think what was that sort of familiar story, which was, you have a group of black technologists who have the ideas, who had the capability, often they're trained at the very elite institutions, but there simply isn't that access to capital that they have not grown up in a network that allows that, they don't have the networks that help to make those entrees and introductions into this world.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Charlton McIlwain:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And often there are simply refusal into the Silicon Valley, into the venture capital spaces that are really needed for that kind of growth. And so when you see and think about the way that the internet changes through the rest of the nineties and your emergence of your Googles, and then later on of the platforms and so forth, it's an enormous amount of capital that it takes to try to compete in that world. And I think that's where everything went to the wayside. You didn't have that level of capital investment in black ideas, in black ventures that allow those things to thrive. And I think if we're looking to the future and what that's going to take in terms of our current array of black entrepreneurs in the digital space of which there are many, it's going to take a lot of that capital investment.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It feels like the narrative has sort of turned to, of course there aren't black-run tech companies.

And of course there's also these endemic problems of racism and gender bias and of course, \", \"[inaudible 00:25:24]\", \" where the two intersect in the venture capital community, where we know that it's much harder for women, it's much harder for people of color to sort of raise money. Do you have people sort of holding up your book and sort of saying, \\\"Wait a second, we've had black entrepreneurs on the web going way the hell back.\\\" Has that narrative caught on or do people sort of look at it like a historical hiccup rather than sort of acknowledging it as a past that could be a future?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Charlton McIlwain:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah.

We're a new generation, but we are standing on shoulders of people who did this before.\\\" And it's almost as if to say, \\\"Look, give us the same chance that some of these folks did and we'll show you what can be done and we'll show you what's possible.\\\" And so, I think that's the connection that's been made. And I think that I've been sort of happy to see being made between what seems like a historical book, but the one that is very much tied to the kind of potential future we could have, which is to say remember, or what if the internet was again, black?

What would that look like? And I think that is the... Number one it's fascinating to me and it's hard to even imagine because we haven't had a lot of experience, at least recent experience with that. But I think that's where I love having had the opportunity to write this book, which is to say we have a glimpse of what is possible because it has been done before. And it has been done successfully before if we provide the same types of opportunities, I can only imagine. What do you think about the kinds of students that you and I encounter on a daily basis and the kind of ideas that they have and so forth?

I think what was most powerful for me coming through and writing this book was to see that man, all of these challenges and problems that we're seeing today, that we tend to see as new as very much in the moment to go back and say, \\\"Wow, we've just really been fighting the same problem for 50, 60 years now.\\\" Right? To see things that aren't new, even if they look in different ways, kind of novel in some respect because of the times that... This is an old battle and that battle is not particularly technological, let's say, or at least first and foremost, that is the issue is fundamentally how do we value people? How do we value groups of people? How do we understand our responsibility to others and connection to others? And then how does that then play out in how we build these kinds of spaces?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And so I think there's a way in which over the years we have said, \\\"Oh, well, if we can just tweak this thing about the technology or that one, or tweak this algorithm versus this, that, and the other that will fix the problem.\\\" And I think it's no, what has persisted is fundamentally our drive for many reasons to exclude folks, to exert power, to cultivate power and so forth in particular areas and communities, and then shun in others. So I think that's where we have to start. And so I think that's one way in which the book helps us kind of move forward. That is, when we're thinking about what's coming next, let's think about what we've seen in the past, where did we go wrong? Where have we repeatedly gone wrong? And then let's try to do something differently.

It's interesting, originally VPRO, the letters actually stand for something called Liberal Protestantism.

Having that as a basis of religious thinking influences also the way you think about life and politics and so on. I think it was in the sixties or seventies or so that we as VPRO did away with this Protestant background, but what's been left in our DNA, you could say, is this free minded, free willing thinking about life and the many opportunities that it gives us to shine, to design, to educate, to do research, to be curious, to really look at the world with as open an eye and open a mind as possible, and to investigate.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But even within a fairly small nation, the Netherlands has not just one public broadcaster as many European countries do, it has eight public broadcasters with different positions, different attitudes.

They're also unions if you will, that people can become a member. Right? So VPRO is a middle-sized broadcaster in terms of membership, which means in the Netherlands you've got about 350,000 paying members. These paying members are people that feel some kind of affiliation to our programming and to our way of thinking. So that gives us a very firm basis in society.

I mean, we've become so dependent upon platforms that are not driven by public value, but by commercial value, that's fairly contrary to what we purport to be or to tell our audiences. I mean, we are critical in some of our programming of Facebook and Google and YouTube and Instagram and all those other big platforms.

I mean, why is it that for such basic utilities, online utilities such as cloud-based collaboration or cooperation, or discovery and search, or even email or watching a video, we need to pay with our data? If you look at equivalents in the physical world, it would be like going to a public square, but only getting access if I'm going to show my passport to some gatekeeper, and this gatekeeper then jotting down all my details and selling them to the highest bidder, which is ridiculous.

Having said that, I think we've got a pretty clear cut road ahead of us. It starts by inventoring the kind of tools and instruments that we are currently using as public organizations. So we've done this exercise for ourselves at VPRO, and what we've seen is that we use about 25 different digital instruments in all our digital environments and apps and so on.

You see, okay, it scores let's say 60%. Then you go out in the world and you look for alternatives that have a higher score on those five failures. There are plenty of those. Because if one thing, I mean the internet, obviously is also a very rich source of open source development, highly intelligent and creative people coming up with all kinds of solutions. It appears that for most of the functionalities that are intrinsic and very essential to our digital lives and functioning, there are tools available that do provide the same kind of functionality without selling our souls and our data to Google and Facebook.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What very often is necessary is some kind of design or user interface research phase that really would make these instruments as user friendly as the ones that are being provided by the big commercial providers at the moment.

At the moment at VPRO, I'm ashamed to say we still use Google Analytics to a large extent. Google Analytics is flexible in the sense that it allows you to configure more or less the amount of data that you share. So we've configured it in such a way that we share as little data as possible with Google. We anonymize IP addresses and so on, and it's all possible within that suit, but still it's controversial.

What's difficult is how you turn all these abstract concepts into something that we can actually work with. Right? I mean, that took us two years. There've been a number of manifests over the last couple of years, that all are based on the same values and the same premises. Look at even the declaration of human rights, same kind of values. In terms of our remit as public organizations, we also obviously refer to our own statutes, right? That also confer being autonomous, which means being independent from any kind of commercial or political or ideological influence, and being able to come to decisions and conclusions on your own, on the merits of your points of view being editorially independent, and so on.

There's certain changes that are fairly easy to make, and you can make your decision around them. If you change your content management system, it probably doesn't have much impact on the user.

So that's helping us. But I think in general, obviously especially from the point of view of public broadcasters, we are content driven. If the content is compelling enough, you get people to new platforms. That's what I firmly believe. I mean, I think Twitter actually got big because of Britain's Got Talent or some kind of show like that, at least in the UK and in Europe, because the BBC was promoting people voting for their contestants on Twitter.

I don't want to know who these girls are, but I do need to know it's only accessible to them. So a certificate could be issued by a health provider, stating that this girl actually is in such a position and she should be allowed access to this forum. Solutions like that.

The other model seems to be the Chinese model, where every app seems to do everything. You build an app to be an integrated ecosystem that does everything from make payments to deliver pizza, to deliver you news. There's occasional outliers in that ecosystem like Telegram, which is built by a pair of exiled Russians who might be in Dubai and might not be.

I mean, for some people they need to be in a world like a Facebook or Twitter, where everything is presented to them and they just type in a box and click send.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"For other people that would never suffice. If they don't build the server from scratch themselves, why are they even putting their words on it? So in between are lots of options. And I try to represent this in many different ways, but in a spectrum, I think is the best way to think of oneself as where do you want to be? And it's not one decision for everything, right? So when I play soccer, I may not want to think about anything, but when I go to work, I want to have total control over everything that I do, right?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So it's just the app can be just looking at your own data, right? It doesn't have to be looking at a shared experience, such as a band. It can just be me individually wanting to see my own tracks and exploring that. I think, how do we achieve the greatness of flexibility and simplicity, insecurity, and trust such that people can really be themselves on that spectrum, whether it be alone, whether it be a service provided for them, whether it be shared, whether it be they control absolutely everything. And that's what's missing today is when you get into something you can't get out and you don't have any choices.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What's very challenging about Solid for people to sort of understand is it's really a very different paradigm than we're used to. We're sort of used to this notion that a service is a place and that place has certain data about us and we have frankly no rights to retrieve that data, right?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Facebook sort of tosses us a bone and we can appeal to download our historic Facebook transactions. Twitter has the ability to get the Twitter archive, but that's very different from the model that you're talking about, where in theory, you could simply revoke an application's permissions to work with your data. You could pull things back, even after having agreed to something.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Help me understand the identity piece of things, which sounds like it's become a much more visible part of the Solid universe since the last time I talked with Sir Tim about this. How do identities work in this space? How do I find you in a Solid world?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Davi Ottenheimer:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The simplest form is that you have a web ID. So in Sir Tim's version everybody has an identity on the web. But one of the things we have to recognize is that identities are very complicated animals. So we've already been dealing with issues where people step off a boat, no records, what is their identity? You assign one or there create one. So that's essentially its own identity space. And then that gets transitioned into when they become a citizen of a country, an existing identity space, they get issued a passport, right?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And so there's a long, long history of what that means in legal vernacular. But then you also have very large identity repositories. Google, for example. So could you go work with a Google that has a Google identity if you wanted to have a Pod? Absolutely. There are questions of Federation. So could you use a web ID in your Pod to use your Google data? We envision all of that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In fact, Okta is a good example of a company that's trying to federate across lots of different stores. But the point is that we're going to try to shift from a place where your identity provider is essentially the center of your world, where once you put your identity on it, you try to connect everything to that identity, to a place where your actual identity, your true human identity is the source of your identity and you occasionally add identity connections, like you get a driver's license to drive, or you get a Google identity to use Google, but that is not your identity. That is a representation of your identity.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In fact, so much. So we're very familiar with cookies and marketing, trying to market to us based on what they perceive us to be. The Pod gives us the ability to move from a right to delete to a right, to be understood. In other words, if I go into a store, like I go into an Ikea and I say, \\\"I want to have, I don't know, pink couches for my decor.\\\" If I go back the next day and they say, \\\"Well, you said you liked pink couches, so how about some pink chairs?\\\" I might want to say, \\\"No, that is not me.\\\" And in my Pod, I can actually shift my dials to say, \\\"I was shopping for my mother or my father. My father likes pink. And today I'm actually this person.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So identity becomes linked to your actual data, your actual self and the right to be understood, which is connected to identity stores. By decoupling the identities that you create in identity places, you can then be a citizen of the United States and a forward on a soccer team and a member of your community. You volunteer for a role, all of this ties in, and then you can in a way, shape how people can see which data based on the role that they're coming with and the role that you have. So it really does represent much more of the human condition unless an identity is offered to you. And now everything tied to it is determined by the identity writer.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Right, right. So the pink couch example reminds me a little bit of Doc Searls work on vendor relationship management, where as opposed to being a customer and having the vendor manage your data, and you have no real control over how they see you as a customer. You're managing your relationship with vendors. You can change your mind and no longer be interested in pink couches or frankly pink couches had nothing to do with your identity in the first place.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But even beyond that, it sounds like there's a radical shift in understanding that people sort of have to get their heads around. When I am using Google services. And to be clear, I use a lot of them, google is providing multiple things. Google is providing an identity. It has some belief that that identity hashes to a person in the real world at the very least it hashes to a mobile phone number and possibly a couple of other email addresses.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Google is a trusted enough identity broker that I can use my Google identity, not only across Google services, but across some other services. I can use my Google email as an identity that allows me to use some other services. I also have my services at Google. I use my email there, I do my calendaring there. Those are apps that are running on my data, and Google of course, has my data for all of those different things.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Sounds like Solid is essentially decoupling all of these things, right? So now I have my data. Either I have it on a Pod that I run on my machine or my little corner of the Cloud, or even conceivably I buy from Google at some point in the future. I have apps, some of which might be run by Google or somebody else that can operate on that data with my permissions.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I have an identity layer, which theoretically could be provided by Google, but might also be provided through something like a net ID, which it sounds like you're thinking about being much more analogous to the sort of right to identity that is probably not firmly established as a human right, but increasingly in terms of refugee issue seems to be emerging as a form of right. That right to personhood instead of identity coming out of it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Assuming that I'm roughly right in that sort of outline, how do we get people to make that conceptual shift? Those are, those are some big changes in how we think about things.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Davi Ottenheimer:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, yeah. So being the national contrarian I am, I would actually say that that's what we were, and we've had to make this rapid shift into this world that we don't actually like to live in. It's like the keyboard learning querty. How do we teach people to write with a pen? Or how do we teach people to use voice in a world of querty? It's like so weird that we have to learn to use the keyboard and we've gotten so accustomed to the Google way of doing things. We don't even realize how bad it is for us.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I mean, the discussions I see today, for example, around school, or they say, well, \\\"We've got a Fitbit and we've got all these trackers.\\\" And so the students running around on a court are going to generate all this, I mean, a basketball court are going to generate all this data, which the school is going to monetize. And I just think, \\\"What?\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"If they type on a keyboard and a computer or a typewriter for that matter, or with a pen and they write a paper out, they use technology, but the school doesn't say we're going to monetize your paper because it's ours. Yet somehow people have gotten into the mindset that the machine generating information as an augment of the human, that data is no longer the person's who's generating the data. Every footstep on the basketball court is not owned by the person who took the footstep?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So that's what's, I think a more natural condition would just be to think that that is their data and the fact that we've shoehorned ourself, pardon the pun into a world where we think we have to live this other way.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I completely I agree with you about the weird nature of that world. I completely agree with you about the ways in which the assumption that all actions are monetizable and they are within the purview of the people who have created the platform. Where I think I might question a little bit is actually going back to your basketball example where, the notion that you own your steps on the basketball court makes sense, though in some ways you're playing basketball with a set of other people, and you could argue that they have some ownership of your steps as well.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And as much as you are engaged in a collaborative experience, I would argue that whoever's providing the court and the hoops probably has some rights in that as well.

So, the only reason I'm picking on your analogy is I think what's so hard is that things really get complex when it's not just a single user's point of view, it's a whole bunch of entities sort of involved with these relationships. And that's why I get really interested when we start thinking about something like the jam example. We build an app, it allows three of us to jam, and maybe it throws in an AI fourth player because we always wanted a sax player to play with. Those questions about data ownership to me get very complicated over time.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Davi Ottenheimer:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, I think lawyers will have to figure this out ultimately, because it's going to be a representation of each relative society that decides how ownership is doled out. But the point again is the flexibility is there. It's not that you have to make a decision. So you figure it out in the spectrum where you are. So you're exactly right.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"If I take a photograph of someone's building, they may try to sue me because it's their building, their visage. But I might say, \\\"No, no, it's a public building that I can take photographs of.\\\" And this is stuff I've dealt with personally across many different cultures. In fact, I've been in some fairly hairy situations where the military has come after me for taking a photo in foreign countries and I've narrowly escaped, taking my camera with me, but deleting the images sort of thing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It's very familiar to me in the sense that, and you're right, the court itself could have a sensor. That data may be owned by the school. The individual may have a sensor. That data may be owned by the individual. And so a lot of it has to deal with how the information is collected. We've seen court cases where police go into cars a year after they'd been in a crash, they pull the black box with all the sensor data, and they say, \\\"You turned on the brakes at this moment and you said you turned it on at this moment, but the sensor proves you wrong.\\\" And the judge says, \\\"Well, that's public information because a brake light is something anyone can see.\\\" Even though it was pulled out of a black box in a wreck, in a junkyard a year after the incident, they're talking about it as though they just looked at it yesterday and it's irrefutable integrity-based information.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And these are things already in the court system about who owns, but I'll go one step higher. We have issues where we have intimate relationships where essentially two people are one and then they get into a dispute and they divorce, or they separate. And we have to treat them as two. So who owns the data? This is not something I'm going to solve. This is something that courts are going to solve, but the difference is the technology can represent them as separate or together, which is not the case today.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But let's talk about who's building with Solid right now because I think people who get their heads around how Solid works are enormously excited about it. I know that I'm enormously excited about it. As I understand it, Inrupt in many ways has been going after massive, massive organizations. The Indian Railway, the British National Health System. You've just given a passionate case that Solid is about the individual. Those are enormous institutions with some of the biggest IT challenges of anyone in the world. Why is Inrupt starting there first with Solid?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Davi Ottenheimer:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Oh, that's an interesting question because it's a function. First of all, the attention that we're getting. You have the Indian Railway coming to you and saying, \\\"We have to move a billion people around. That's a lot of people.\\\" So it would be useful to try to individually go to individual one by one billion people, but you may never get there by the time... I'm an old man already, so I may not be around by the time I get to the halfway through.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Whereas if you go to a representation of those people, who's going to deal with them already in the way that they lived their lives. You can actually get much, further, much more traction and a much quicker timescale. Eventually people will get it wider too, but really to put it this way, I once tried to help solve an issue they had in China with the way that the railway tickets were being issued. They were too slow. People would walk away from the kiosks.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So instead of trying to go to each individual and say, \\\"We can write an app for you to get on the train...\\\" This is actually a question that sort of gets to me around the Uber phenomenon.

And I think we can do both, but I think that in terms of leverage, it's better to enable the people that already have on the ground technology solutions. When the NHS says we want to fix our healthcare system, who would we to be to say no to fixing the entire NHS healthcare system, because we're really focused on trying to get 1,000 or 10,000 people interested to write apps.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Certainly one of the places that people are asking a lot of questions about whether existing models work are contemporary social media. We have a group of people asking whether there are dark patterns that are leading towards addiction or leading people to spend too much time with these platforms. We have, what I think are very legitimate critiques about whether existing social problems like polarization and such are being pushed into new communities and aggravated by social platforms. Is the future of social media on Inrupt's agenda?

I mean, if you had said in 1994, that we're going to have shopping carts or even that even that we'll chat on the web, I don't think people would have seen it because back then we use chat apps, phone, and lots of stuff in Unix and VMS for that matter. There's lots of ways to chat.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But if you think in terms today of what's possible, since we know all of that history, then there's no question that linking and interconnectivity includes social media and chat. But I think it's important to note, again, there's a spectrum and there's two sides to all of this. Some people want everything to be archived forever. So if I have all of my chats since forever, the same way email, since forever in my Pod, that can serve a very useful purpose as an academic, as a scholar of a university.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I want to have all my chats, or president of United States, all the chats recorded and something that's in perpetuity put into a museum. That's very powerful, but some people want it to be all erased. They want to have absolutely no record. They want to be anonymous all the time. We can serve both of those. And that's something that you don't find right now, because if you get into a Twitter or you get into a Facebook and you get into the terms of service, they say it won't be private. And this is what happens if you don't want the data to be stored, this is how we delete, even though it doesn't get deleted or how...\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I mean, one of the biggest crimes I think is like, when WhatsApp will say it's end-to-end encrypted, but there's a third party key that's in there and they actually can flip a switch and they encrypt everything with a third key and they can read everything that was supposedly \\\"end-to-end encrypted\\\".

I think, Ethan, you and I went back and forth on this question of, \\\"What is a platform and how do we define it for the purposes of this inquiry?\\\" Where we landed in defining platform is that these are essentially media platforms where users can post their ideas in various forms, so that could be text, or that could be audio, or that could be video, and these are usually free services, so they're monetized by advertising on the platform side, so the kind of like platform, traditional platform function of a social media platform is to really bring together those advertisers, marketers, the users who are creating content.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This includes Facebook and includes Twitter, it includes YouTube.

We turned in a draft of this before the Capitol riot, and we talked about the importance of being able to study platforms like Gab and Parler, and then suddenly, we had this very clear example of why it was so important to study them, so this is really a study of how researchers are trying to get information from these different platforms, what are the different strategies that they're using. First of all, what do academic, and activist, and journalistic researchers want to know?

What does the spread look like? What does it look like when a particular piece of content goes viral or moves through a particular network?\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The real challenge, particularly on a platform like Facebook is that when you start to answer those content questions, you immediately bump up against this problem that the data that's available around reach is different than the data that's available around engagement.

I mean, one way to think about this is that a platform like Twitter is mostly a public platform, right? Generally, when you're tweeting, the vast majority of tweets are not protected, they're going out to the entire world, and you can look and maybe make some estimates about reach, how many people are seeing them. You can certainly see information like how many people liked them, how many people retweeted them and shared them. Facebook is a different critter, and most Facebook feeds are private.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"They're shared with a small number of people, and so even asking a question like, \\\"How often did this URL appear on Facebook?,\\\" can be somewhat controversial. You're basically asking for an aggregate of people's private sharing. Facebook reveals some of this information.

Many people liked it, many people shared it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What we don't know is how many people have seen a given post, the actual reach of these things, and so far, Facebook, for the most part, isn't giving us that data. We just interviewed Julia Angwin of The Markup and her Citizen Browser Project, which is one of the things that we write about in this report, and that's really the first effort that's making a guess at what the reach is of some of these things, but, Elizabeth, one of the things I found so fascinating about writing this with you ... I'm a researcher. I generally just want to grab the platforms and kind of shake all the data out of them. You made a very convincing case that the platforms often have a really good reason why it's hard to share this data. Make that case for me.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. Sure. I think what I heard from our interviews about why it's hard for platforms to share this data is that at the highest level, there's a whole thicket of privacy regulations, both domestically and especially globally, coming out of the European Union, that actually make it legally risky for platforms to share this data. Those are not concerns that we should take lightly. The Cambridge Analytica scandal was a scandal because there was personally identifiable information that users did not consent to be released.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That was released to researchers and beyond, so those privacy considerations and the constraints on platforms that are created by those privacy regulations are real.

Social Science One was this very ambitious research effort, organized by a pair of just top social scientists to work with Facebook, to open up a data set, in particular, to study political influence and elections, instead of Facebook's role within it. Despite the fact that the academics who started the project had great contacts within Facebook, and despite the fact that the people the data was opened up to were a set of accomplished academics, had been very carefully screened, Facebook had a really hard time opening up the data, and many of the people who were involved with the project ended up just incredibly frustrated. One of the interesting things though, is that there's lots of what you might consider to be informal data collection. Tell us a little bit about some of the people like Pushshift, who are doing this work informally.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. I think part of the interesting finding for me and kind of doing this exercise of mapping the landscape on the methodology side is that people are really attacking this problem of platform data access in a variety of ways. Social Science One was the sort of official attempt to create a front door to some of this data for Facebook, but Pushshift and others are engaging in their own scraping of platform data, which is what we categorize in the paper as unsanctioned, so they are absolutely taking on some legal risk in doing this, but they are doing it and they are engaged in a kind of interesting and ongoing cat and mouse game, as some of these platforms attempt to shut off their access, and detect their scraping efforts, but that's really, that's a side door that some of these intrepid researchers are creating to scrape publicly available data, or data that you can get from a handful of kind of logged in users, and to collate that across platforms, so it's not just that there's a single platform under \", \"[city 00:12:06]\", \", but the really cool thing about Pushshift is that they're looking across platforms.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, Pushshift is remarkable.

We saw-\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Twitter as well.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What's that?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And Twitter as well.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah.

Can you talk a little bit about the NYU Ad Observatory?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. The NYU Ad Observatory created a browser plug-in that would allow web social media users like you and me to install this in our browser, and then they would collect data using that plug-in from our Facebook feeds. Now, sometime in, I want to say it was November, Facebook sent a letter to them saying, \\\"This violates our terms of service. Please cease and desist.\\\" This caused a kerfuffle amongst the researchers that we've been studying and working with because this kind of methodology is really one of those ways to get around some of these data access issues and to actually go right at the problem of user consent, so if you are a user and you are consenting to plugging this tool into your browser, you are essentially saying, \\\"Yes, researcher, it is okay for you to collect this data,\\\" and of course, for us, as researchers, who've been trained to respect user consent and to work with our IRB, is that's a hugely important component to doing high quality ethical research. It was a really interesting example of how, even if you can net out the problems of user consent, there may still be some residual platform resistance to those kinds of data collection methods.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Our early indications on the NYU Ad Observatory is that Facebook is making the argument that the users can't consent to do that, which is interesting, right? On the one hand, it's quite possible that Facebook's terms of service is interpretable in a way that says you can't give anyone unauthorized access to this. At the same time, it seems like what I see on Facebook is something that I should have control over, whether I share it with someone else. That isn't a trade secret, what Facebook is showing to me versus someone else. There are things that researchers want to study that just aren't likely ever to be released. Can you talk about people who are trying to study moderation decisions?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. I think, Ethan, you should weigh in here because I think some of those interviews were also yours, but part of what I heard in the, amongst the researchers who are looking at moderation decisions is that it can be very difficult. It can be very difficult to study takedowns kind of after they happen, and so getting some kind of deep retrospective like long-term longitudinal view of the outcome of those decisions can actually be incredibly difficult. It's also difficult to study at a policy level like to what extent the stated policies are actually being followed through and what the results of those are, and kind of what the distribution of those content moderation decisions actually is. I'm curious what you heard from-\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, I ... One of the things I would say is a lot of the research that people are doing is descriptive, right? It's basically, who's tweeting about what, and who's sharing what content, and what URLs are most prominent? When you start studying things like moderation decisions, you're often actually moving into the realm of an audit, and you're trying to ask the question of, \\\"Are a company's processes fair or not?\\\" For instance, Palestinians have long complained that their content gets taken down much more often than Israeli content does.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That's something that should be auditable, right? It should be possible to look in there and sort of say Israeli posts that are pro-Israel get taken down at this rate, pro-Palestine get taken down at this rate. Black Lives Matter protesters have complained about this. There's been a big dialogue within some black rights communities suggesting that criticizing whiteness is a way of getting taken down. It would be really nice to be able to sort of come in and evaluate those things. Those tend to be information that platforms hold very tight to.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Handing out information, instead of saying, \\\"Here is content that came in, and we decided to take it down,\\\" you can imagine the ways in which this could be very dangerous for a platform, right? This is content that they took down in part because they didn't want to get sued, or they were afraid of liability around that. In the long run, Elizabeth, how do we study these things? Is this something that independent researchers and journalists can study? Does the government have to get involved? Are there audit strategies that sort of get us there?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Do you mean particularly on the moderation front or in general?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I would say in general, right? If one camp says, \\\"Let's just scrape the heck out of this. Let's go to the courts. We're going to scrape as much as we can. We're going to study it.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We have sort of a Julia Angwin camp that says, \\\"Put plug-ins in the browsers. Let's see it from the user point of view.\\\" That's almost certainly going to get litigated. There's a camp that says if the platforms were just good to citizens and gave us APIs, like Twitter recently did, we'd solve the problem, but it still seems like there's cases like moderation where we need something much closer to an audit system.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. Ethan, I think we together did a really good job coming at this with different perspectives and sometimes different opinions to assemble a range of options because, I think in this space, as in many others, there is no silver bullet, and so it really does have to be a combination of like cooperation, cooptation, and opposition, I think data collection strategies to get us there. Under the cooperation front, I think as flawed as Social Science One was, and as frustrating as it was for its participants, it's an important kind of first step to figuring out what a cooperative model looks like and what the constraints and interests are in both sides, and what happens when lots of talk about cooperation actually meets like governance and workflow decisions, and so my sense is, from talking with the researchers in this study, that will continue and that's a productive and important avenue to keep open, but that is not to the exclusion, I think of these oppositional efforts, for sure. It's also not to the exclusion, I think of regulatory approaches, some of which we can talk about. It's not to the exclusion, I think of the call for new civil society institutions that can do this because there are definitely whole sections of this problem that are not going to be solved by regulation, are not going to be solved by cooperation, are not going to be solved by individuals banding together in oppositional data collection, but can actually be solved by audit bodies, for example. \", \"[crosstalk 00:20:59]\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Let's dig into those two things.

I think there's, as you and I have periodically discussed, there's a whole thicket, and I mean thicket in every sense of that word, of regulatory policy coming out of the European Union that has tried to get at this, a version of this researcher exception, and from what we heard, is kind of at some level, creating more problems than it solves, but the advantage to our European friends, like cutting that Gordian Knot and really figuring out at the EU level what some research exemptions would be would actually help the rest of us because so much of that policy is kind of like the master policy for research work here as well, just because of how platforms are tuning their policy decisions. That's another kind of like in the realm of the possible but difficult. The other, I think, interesting and important long-term kind of tectonic policy shift that I think would be very interesting is a complete reclassification here domestically of social media platforms as common carriers.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We had a couple of very interesting off-the-record conversations informing this report with folks in D.C. who really feel like a reclassification of social platforms under common carrier legislation would open up a range of rule-making possibilities that could really help us make progress on this researcher access and data access.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Part of what might become possible in a common carrier situation is that platforms might become significantly more auditable, and there might be a federal level regulatory response that said the platforms were auditable in certain ways. One of the wackiest ideas in this report that we ended up sort of putting out there is this idea that you might almost imagine algorithmic auditors who are not unlike the ways in which publicly traded businesses are fiscally audited to make sure that they're following best accounting practices. Of course, part of what happens in this is we don't know what a best algorithmic practice is. Our folks in the fair community, who are sort of trying to figure out questions of equity and fairness in AI, that's going to be a really, really open topic if we sort of get to that place. Elizabeth, let me say, for me, maybe the biggest surprise in all of this work was this idea of a tension between privacy advocates and researchers.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"No one, I think wanted to say, \\\"Damn, you privacy advocates,\\\" but it was often a situation where researchers who really want to understand what was happening on these platforms found themselves intentioned with privacy advocates, and of course, many of these players see themselves as allies.

It was hopeful because, I think the way one policymaker framed it to me was like, \\\"We have this legislation.\\\" It's not like we have to write something new. These powers exist.

I'm your host, Ethan Zuckerman. We are here today with Julia Angwin, one of my favorite people in the world. An incredible investigative journalist. She's worked with the Wall Street Journal. She worked for quite some time with ProPublica. She is co-founder of a wonderful project called The Markup. We're going to talk about how investigative journalism can help us understand what's going on with social media and what might be wrong with it.

And why is it so unusual?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The Markup is this nonprofit newsroom that has been up and running, we've been publishing for almost a year now and we cover the impact of technology on society. The idea of how technology is used to unfortunately cement inequities and to force some people to algorithmic systems and others not. And we also look at social media and how it amplifies certain voices and some not. And we do all this with using technology. Half of the newsroom is programmers and half are more traditional journalists. And so we partner the traditional journalism with the data driven journalism and we feel like that can super power our investigations.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Give me a sense for how that's different from some of the work you were doing with ProPublica. While you were over with ProPublica, you did some really groundbreaking work doing often some very technical analysis, some really terrific work on systems that were being used in the criminal justice system in Florida that were systemically recommending people of color as having a much higher risk of jumping bail than white people. You've been at this for a while. What's unusual about doing it at The Markup rather than doing it through some of the other institutions you've worked with?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, I've been trying to do this, I've worked for a decade now, but the challenge has been both at the Wall Street Journal and at ProPublica, which by the way, are both great newsrooms and well resourced newsrooms, is that there's truly not enough data reporters go around. Essentially they're in a big newsroom like that, might be 10 data reporters for hundreds of other reporters to use as their partners. And so it becomes a little bit of a DMV situation, you have to take a number, wait in line. And I was always sort of in trouble a little bit for overusing the data resources. And so I would often have to go hire contract programmers to work with me because I believe strongly that we as journalists, we're outgunned, out spent and we have to use every possible tool in our arsenal.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And of course those tools tend to be human sources. Interviewing real people, documents, public records, but automation and computation can be one of those tools. And I really believe that we need to use all of those things in order to get the truth. And so the computation automation piece can be very scarce in these newsrooms. And so I wanted to build a newsroom where that was baked into the fabric from the beginning. One thing about The Markup is the data reporters don't report to a different data editor. They are part of the investigative team. They come up with investigative story ideas. They're true partners and it's not a service desk that's over strapped and under resourced, like I've experienced in other places.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The data reporters are the center of the equation. And then they're paired up with someone who has programming skills, has data munging skills. What are the sort of job descriptions for those two partners within a relationship?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We have data journalists who have an array of data skills, because actually there's a whole bunch of things that fall into the bucket data. We have everything from one Leon Yin who was a data scientist before coming to us and had spent no time in a newsroom. And then we have Emmanuel Martinez who is a long time data journalist, already has a Pulitzer finalist from his work at Reveal and they have very different skills. We do some people are really good at scraping. Some people are really good at data analysis and statistics. Some are really good at just traditional public records requests and compiling those into data sets. Our data journalists have a lot of different skills.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Then on the human reporting side, which I don't know a better way to describe it, is the traditional skills, which is going out, finding people, getting them to talk to you on the phone. Those are actually super hard. And it's worth pointing out that the data reporters, the price point for them is higher because the market values them. But the truth is that the work by the human reporters is actually just as hard and sometimes harder. And particularly in a pandemic when you can't go out and knock on people's doors and at least you can, but you won't get as nice a reception. Not that we ever got such great reception as journalists, but we partner those two skills together.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I think one thing that's really important is that we believe that you can't analyze data in a vacuum. You can't just walk in and say, \\\"I want a dataset about X,\\\" and know nothing about X. A whole bunch of work happens before we collect data where we develop what we call domain expertise. The story you were mentioning about criminal risk scores that I did at ProPublica, we spent six months understanding and reporting about risk scores. What were the challenges? What were the issues before we went and collected data? Because you have to know what question you're trying to ask and what data you need to answer it before you even start data collection.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Give me a sense for the sort of stories that The Markup is telling what this method. Combining terrific human reporters, who are sort of domain experts or who can become domain experts, data reporters, who really have the freedom to be part of the investigative team, sort of go out and get these things. What is the beat for The Markup? Is that any data story? Or what's the specific focus?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I would love if we could do any data story, but we're very small. And so we limit ourselves to what we call the impact of technology on society. Now, of course, today in today's world where our entire life is mediated by technology and we literally have no relationships that don't involve technology, that is a pretty big beat. We do have a lot of latitude to operate, but an example of a story that we did that I think is indicative of how we work is the one we wrote about how Google was preferencing itself in search results.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Anyone who's ever searched for anything on Google has noticed that at the top of the search results, there's all sorts of little info boxes and video carousels and all sorts of stuff that is, I think, meant to be helpful, but it also means that the sort of links out to the outer world are pushed way down the page. And many of those links inside of the boxes, in the info boxes are actually just to Google itself. And so we wanted to measure this. Our reporter who'd been covering this topic for a long time, even before she came to The Markup, had heard from people who were like, my business was destroyed because Google pushed me so far down the page.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Like all good stories that started with a tip, and then we're like, okay, well, let's see if we can actually measure, because we love to measure things at The Markup. And so we're like, can we measure how much of the page they're taking up? It took a long time and Leon had to develop a way of actually analyzing the page. He borrowed from biology and the idea of staining a cell to see which parts of it were different than others. We actually scraped all these search result pages and then stained them to identify which parts were the Google products in which parts were links to the external web. And we were able to say at the end of the day that Google was preferencing itself quite a bit. 40% of the first page was their own products and actually 60% of the first screen, if you were really looking, thinking about it from a mobile point of view.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And we were really proud that that finding was of course used and referenced in the House antitrust landmark report and that in many of the Department of Justice and other anti-trust cases against Google have cited this because you can know something, but not know it until the data is there to support what you thought you knew.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And of course my next question was going to be about impact, but you've already anticipated it. I know this is something that ProPublica is incredibly thoughtful about is sort of maintaining almost a portfolio of impacts that a story can have. It sounds like you're having some of the same thing in sort of analyzing technical systems and particularly the sort of technical systems that we interact with every day, whether it's search engines, whether it's social media. A lot of our conversation on this podcast is about sort of diagnosing and then sort of envisioning fixes for social media as it currently exists. What have you sort of been able to figure out applying these techniques to understand Facebook, YouTube, other social networks out there?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think that diagnosis is the right word. We see ourselves as diagnosing these problems so that they can be solved. We don't have the perfect policy solution. We don't propose policy solutions, but I think when you get really close to a topic and really precise about the diagnosis, then the solution actually can more naturally reveal itself. We wrote a story recently about Facebook and how they had said they were stopping recommending political groups. And then our data showed that they didn't stop. And we have a hypothesis we haven't been able to prove, but it looks in the data like they just stopped recommending groups that self-identified themselves with a political tag. And that's a really easy thing to fix. There's plenty of machine learning they could apply to this to turn off anyone who is political and not just rely on that user identified tag.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And in fact, since our story ran, they have turned off political group recommendations. And I think maybe they applied that. I will never know. I'm not inside Facebook so I don't know how that is, but we see that as impact too. It's not just legislation. Unfortunately, the truth is like the federal government doesn't even necessarily have as much power as these companies and so much of what the impact is, is the companies themselves choosing to do something.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Let's look at Facebook specifically, not because it's the center of the universe and I think you and I would probably both agree that there are some platforms like YouTube that tend not to be as carefully looked at, but Facebook has some unique problems when you go to study it. The truth is what I am seeing on Facebook is not public knowledge. It's been put together for me as part of my Facebook feed. You don't have an easy way of seeing what's on my Facebook feed. How is The Markup dealing with this question of studying something like the question of how much political content is being posted across Facebook?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. It's a really hard question and one that I've thought about a lot. And I ultimately came to the realization that we were going to have to do something pretty crazy in order to answer this question. And what that crazy thing was is a project called Citizen Browser. Basically we have built a tool, kind of a custom web browser that we distribute to panelists who we pay to install it on their computer. And they log into Facebook through this app and then they never touch it again. But it allows us to once or twice a day, take a scan of what's at the top in their newsfeed. We then put it through this crazy pipeline where we redact every bit of personally identifiable information about them and their friends and any comments and messages, anything personal, photos. And what we're left with at the end is a data set that we hope really shows what Facebook is choosing to push to the top of the feed.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This is the choice that Facebook has made, that they're going to put X and Y at the top and they're not going to put other things as high. And the only way to do that because everyone's feed is individual, is to build this panel. And so we've taken this panel approach, which has been extremely expensive and we've had eight developers, 10 months, it's an enormous effort. It costs half a million dollars a year in a run. I'm currently raising money for that so if anyone's listening, please send us a big check. And so, but I do think it's the only way, there may be other ways, but it's one of the best ways I can think of to try to monitor this black box.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of the analogies that I've sort of thought of for Citizen Browser is almost this notion of people creating their own network of air sensors. There are projects out there in places where we don't have very good readings of air quality, people buy a sensor, sort of hanging in their backyard and collectively we got a much finer grained set of detail. A little different here in the sense that you're actually recruiting people, you're paying people. How are you sort of recruiting people into this panel? Can anyone join? Or are you trying to get a specific subset of people?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"No, we don't have everyone joining. And the reason for that is I had done something similar to this when I was at ProPublica called the Facebook Political Ad Collector, which we just offered to readers and ask them to donate. It looked at their feed and extracted ads and sent them to us so we could see what political ads were being shown. But the ProPublica readership was very liberal and so we basically only got liberal ads. And so it was a really limited and useful, but limited window into Facebook. And so that's why when I just wanted to take another stab at this question, I realized we're going to have to pay people so we could get a representative sample. We don't have, by the way, as many Trump voters as we do Biden voters. And that's how we're making the distinction on political affiliation.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"You could do it lots of ways, but that seemed like the most obvious way to do it in this year. And that's something that a lot of pollsters have struggled with is there's a lot of skepticism about institutions and the media in among Trump voters. And so it is hard to get them to participate. We still have a skewed panel, more Biden, but it means that we have a healthy representation of both sides. And so allows us to at least have a window into what this filter bubble looks like. How do things look on one side versus the other?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And what are you learning so far? You've got a sort of a unique perspective on this. Like I mentioned before, there really is no easy way to sort of look at a Republican Twitter feed or an AOC fan Facebook feed. Try that again. There really is no easy way to look at a Trump supporter's Facebook feed, because that is private information you're now getting indications of something that frankly, the rest of us really haven't had a good chance to see. What are you finding sort of in general terms around that?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, we're finding that as Eli Pariser predicted, the feeds do look really different. The world looks really different when you look through the lens of a conservative versus a liberal user of Facebook. And we've been looking at all the different distinctions, that one seems like the most stark. There is difference between age like millennials versus boomers. There's small differences for women and men. There's differences urban, rural. But the biggest difference we've seen is on this political spectrum and the news that they see is entirely different.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And your sense is that this is how much of this do you think is Facebook's algorithms trying to give people what they're going to want? How much of this is homophily? People on the right, have a lot more friends who are on the right, people who are in rural areas probably have more info coming from rural areas. Do you have a sense yet for what of this just comes from who are friends and people's feeds versus this potentially being aggravated by Facebook a la the filter bubble hypothesis?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, it's really hard to say because we deliberately strip out personally identifiable information about people and their friends. And so we aren't doing an analysis of what their network is and how it contributes because of the privacy concerns. It means that we are a little bit blind to that issue. And we want to be really clear about our limitations there, which is, we made this choice deliberately to decide that protecting the privacy of the panelists was more important than answering that question. But I think that even the fact that we have a limited answer, meaning all we know is what the outcome was. We know the outcome. The outcome is the feeds look really different. How much of it is Facebook's fault? How much is the user? That we can't distinguish but I think it allows that conversation to begin and Facebook can then step in and say, \\\"Okay, well, we can respond by saying, okay, now that's not us.\\\" And then at least the conversation moves a little bit forward. And that's what I want to do is push the ball forward.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. I think that notion of these studies potentially forcing a response from the platform is pretty interesting. Can you talk about how that's worked in the past with Facebook? You've crossed swords with Facebook previously around the subject of ad targeting. How have they responded to that research? Sort of where has that led you in the past?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, so couple of years back, oh my gosh. I think it was 2016. I wrote about how Facebook had this dropdown menu for advertisers. You go in, you want to buy an ad and it's like, do you want to target it to basically different ethnicities? And it would say, not only do you want to target these ethnicities, but do you want to block these ethnicities from seeing the ad? I thought, well, huh, could you actually do housing discrimination this way? Because it's against a lot to advertise your housing to just one race or deny some people of some race to see the ad. And we bought an ad that was discriminated. It said, \\\"Don't show this housing ad to black people.\\\" And it went through and it approved. There was a big outcry, Facebook said they're going to fix it. They said they would build an algorithm to identify how these types of ads, they built the algorithm. And then I went in, tested it, bought the same ad, it still got approved.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I said to them at the time of the algorithm, I was like, \\\"You could build an algorithm to this. You could also just get rid of the dropdown menu that says block Black people from seeing that.\\\" I was like, I don't know, I'm not a super expert person, but that seems like an option. They're like, \\\"No, no, no, we have to build this massive algorithm.\\\" Then what happened is that not I but then the fair housing groups continued to buy ads after that. Were able to get them through, HUD sued them. Finally, it wasn't until last summer that they were like, you know what? I think we're going to get rid of the drop down menu to block Black people from seeing dads. And it was like, that took five years.

Not only do we not have a national algorithmic auditing body, but as we've sort of established in this conversation, the only way to actually go ahead and audit these algorithms is either by buying ads on the services, which by the way, the services periodically complain is not a fair use of them. Or by starting to collect data through something like a panel. We're seeing other cases where Facebook has actually reacted pretty angrily to this. They've sent a cease and desist and put a demand date on it to the NYU Ad Observatory Project. Have you had any pushback from Facebook yet on the panel study?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"All of my fingers and toes are crossed while I'm answering this question, but no, we haven't heard anything from them.

And the argument they made there is that that was not valid. Those people don't have the right to share that data. Yeah, they might make that argument to us. And I think that that's an argument that we should all have. Do we have any ownership over our own social media data? I think I would like to see the courts weigh in because I feel like the very least we should have partial ownership of it. I don't know. I'm not a property lawyer but it seems like to me.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's all sorts of layers to this. Essentially you're using the service. Facebook is giving you information in exchange for the ability to surveil you at all times, you would think that being able to say, \\\"Hey, third party, this is what Facebook is showing me,\\\" would be a right that you have. It's not a secret that you have entered into with them. Beyond that is the sort of larger question of, if Facebook and these other companies let's be clear, it isn't just Facebook that does this. If an advertising company is enabling racial based housing discrimination, someone needs to be able to audit that. Maybe where we end up on this is having some sort of national audit bodies that are looking at these questions like racial discrimination. What are the things you most want to know at this point?

They have this incredible power and they can take and lift somebody out of obscurity and make them go viral and they can suppress content. There was a Wall Street Journal story about how Facebook had chosen to suppress Mother Jones. They just decided they thought it was too partisan. And so those are the questions I'm concerned about because I view my job as accountability. And I think that accountability is for the platform and their choices. There are other questions to be asked, which is how do humans respond to what Facebook is doing to them? How do you get radicalized? And those are harder questions for me to answer. I would still love to know the answer, but I think for me, I view my lens through how can I hold the platforms accountable for the choices that they make? What content they choose to take down, what content they choose to leave up, what content they rise up in the feed, what content they suppress.

One is the way that Facebook and other platforms have gotten more aggressive or at least claim to have gotten more aggressive about blocking certain types of mis and dis-information. I noticed just instead of watching the field, that when you started having quite aggressive anti-vax content, particularly around COVID, so the Plandemic video, we actually saw much more aggressive suppression of content than I'd seen previously. At the same time, our friend, Kevin Roose is pounding relentlessly on Facebook about the fact that Dan Bongino seems to show up as the most popular individual in the world, despite being pretty little known outside of far right wing circles. Do you have a way of sort of, you can study the outputs, you can't really study the inputs. Is there a good way using Citizen Browser that you think you can figure out figures who are sort of disproportionately popular or who Facebook's algorithm really seems to love or really seems to hate?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Julia Angwin:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We do see that to some extent. We have a fairly small panel. Facebook is 2.7 billion users and we have about 2,000 panelists. We see that there are some things that are more popular than others and we would like to believe that our panel is representative enough that that means something. Facebook's data is always going to be better.

I also think the example that you just gave with Amazon is this great reminder that it's possible to be dumb as well as evil or even dumb instead of evil. As I understand the Amazon situation, they trained a machine learning algorithm on the people that they had hired and it turned out that they rejected lots of women so the characteristics of women on resumes like playing on the women's volleyball team or studying women's studies, all became negative indicators of what it would mean to be a good Amazon employee.

Obviously, the result of Wikipedia, i.e. the encyclopedia itself, is pretty remarkable. We're one of the most popular websites in the world and famous all over the world with millions and millions of entries of generally okay quality, and some of them quite excellent, and some of them need some work. That's the nature of Wikipedia. I'm also very proud of the community. I'm proud of my role in that community in the sense of, I didn't write this encyclopedia, but I did play a part. I'm happy about that community and the values that we put in place in the early days of thoughtfulness, kindness, quality. One of the oldest rules of Wikipedia, which I remember writing, was no personal attacks, which is quite rare on the internet, as we know. That's kind of amazing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Then there's also the business model, so to speak, in the sense not just that we're a nonprofit organization, because I think that that's a piece of it, but also that we don't get money by selling data, we don't get money by having ads. We just ask people to support us, and that's it, and it works. That's kind of an amazing thing. I'm sure we'll get into this in great detail, but it has a lot of implications that people might not have thought about, and in fact, indeed from the early days of Wikipedia, I didn't think of all of the implications of what an advertising only business model meant. I just knew I didn't want that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, I think almost no one thought, about at that point, what we were buying into when we were buying into the advertising business model. A lot of what I want to talk with you today is about WT social, but I want to run something past you because I actually think it's one of the more extraordinary things that Wikipedia and Wikimedia more broadly have accomplished. If we were having this conversation 10 years ago, we would be talking about accuracy. We would be talking about, is it dangerous that anyone can write whatever they want on Wikipedia? We're now at a point where YouTube uses Wikipedia to try to provide neutral factual content to counter disinformation that's spreading on their service. In other words, in a world where everything appears to be in dispute, where you have fights over reality within politics, the Wikipedia model has somehow emerged as one of the few ways to make things genuinely knowable. Are you at all surprised by that? You were right in the middle of a ton of those debates a decade ago. Am I over-hyping it, or does that line up with how you think about it?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Jimmy Wales:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"No, it's certainly the case. What I've taken to saying is that we were never as bad as they said we were, and we are not as good as they think we are. There was kind of a hype cycle around Wikipedia. I always used to remind fellow Wikipedians when we get some really bad press about some error in Wikipedia to say, look, I remembered a few years prior when eBay was first a thing ... eBay, of course, is very different, but also faced this question of, I'm going to send my money and somebody is going to actually send me the Pez dispenser? Is that insane? I said, look, there was a brief period of time when it was very fashionable, mainly because it was easy and lazy to do as a journalist, to write a story that said, oh my God, someone's selling their baby on eBay. Someone's selling their gun on eBay. Look at this horrible thing that's happening on eBay.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Then after a little while people realize, you know what? You can go on eBay and you can list your baby for sale, somebody is going to flag it and they're going to take it down. It's not that exciting. It's really not that interesting, but it seemed interesting for a little while. Similarly at Wikipedia, yeah, you can go and click edit and change an entry to be something ridiculous, and then somebody is going to fix it in five minutes, and that's kind of okay. It's not great, but it's just part of the process, and in fact, that process yields something quite good over a long period of time. There was that blip in time when it was just like ... Well, gosh, I remember when Anna Nicole Smith died, she was a famous sort of actress, model? I'm not exactly sure what she was, but ... Reality celebrity.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Those terms all apply.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Jimmy Wales:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"She died of, I think, some sort of drug problems or whatever, and somebody vandalized Wikipedia to say bad things about her. Then I got calls from eight journalists that day. It was tabloid papers that I didn't normally hear from, because of that, and one of them said to me, does this show a fundamental flaw in the Wikipedia model? I couldn't help myself. I said, it's a fundamental flaw with tabloid newspapers that Anna Nicole Smith dies and I get eight phone calls about it. Honestly, it's not that interesting. None of this is. By the way, there's actual news somewhere in the world, I'm sure. That's changed. But again, we try to be humble about where we are today. Yes, of course. People do trust us more than they used to, but yes, we know there are errors and Wikipedia, there are problems, there's things that we could improve. It is better than it used to be, because, well, that's the whole point. We're always trying to make it better. But there's still a lot of work to do, and we can't be complacent about that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It feels to me like the process is one that, actually, we could learn a lot from, which is that the first article is not necessarily very good. As people keep adding to it, it's going to get better and better over time, and at a certain point, when we're at a point of near stability, we then get into a sort of vandalism prevention mode. I think one of the things I've marveled about is that Wikipedia seems really, really good at some things, and then has had a harder time with other things. For instance, WikiTribune, which was a focus of yours for a while, and tell me if I'm not being fair, was taking something of a Wikipedian approach to news. It always felt to me in some ways like Wiki Tribune's toughest competition was Wikipedia, which actually does news surprisingly well. Has it been hard to bring this process that seems to work so well in the encyclopedia into other spheres?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. It's really interesting, because the encyclopedia as a genre is unique in certain ways. One, it's supposed to be neutral. That's really important, because it does allow people of different ideas to find a way to work together harmoniously. Maybe you and I are going to edit a piece about some politician and we disagree. I think they're good and you don't like them so much. Well, we both know we're going to try to be neutral, so if we're reasonable people, we can find ways to say, the person was criticized for this, but the response was that, and we can present the issue to people.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It's also evergreen, which means ... That was one of the earliest problems. Of course, the Wikimedia foundation has Wiki News, which was an early attempt to news. I remember a case, and you can date this from when it happened. When George W. Bush was reelected, Colin Powell resigned soon after, and all media were reporting it an expected resignation, that he was ready to retire. It was not really a big scandalous story. Wiki News was reporting it as, everybody's jumping ship on the Bush administration now, in a slightly different way. I thought, I think that's slanted and I think it's a little bit biased, and I should fix it. But of course, it's a news story and I didn't have time that day, and by three days later, it didn't matter anymore. Whereas if you go to the article on Colin Powell, which is going to be there for, if I have anything to do with it, a hundred years, it's slowly refined ...\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"You can fix it.

Those are some of the things that make it easier to do an encyclopedia. Then for news, for me with WikiTribune, and actually WT social is the kind of continuation and a modification of it, is really to ask ourselves the question, we've got a lot of great people in the world, and you wouldn't know it from looking at Twitter or something like that. You can find great people anywhere, but a lot of the systems out there seem to be designed to amplify the loudest and most inflammatory voices. Where are the quiet, thoughtful people who are wanting to engage with journalism and news in new ways, and what can they actually contribute to the process? Sometimes I think that journalists don't have the right idea about this, because they don't really know Wikipedians.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Many good journalists think that they're the only ones who can actually be neutral and interpret the world in that kind of journalistic way. I know that's wrong. But they do have certain advantages that most people don't have, which is the institution behind them that gives them access. If you're the new treasury secretary and you get a call that says the New York Times would like to speak to you, you take that call. If you get that some rando from some website wants to talk to you, you just don't have time. That's just practical. Right? Sometimes it's unfortunate because then we know there's a lot of access journalism and things that come bad with that. But the truth is, there's not much you can do about that. Ordinary people are never going to have access. That's a tricky problem, but I still think there's there's room for new ways of thinking and new systems. This is where we are at WT Social, to say, how can people engage with news, engage with journalism in a way that isn't just yelling at each other, and is constructive and positive? I haven't figured it out yet, but we're working on it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Let's talk about the logic of WT Social. You just gave us a big clue on it, which is that it's about meaningful conversation about events in the news. You talked a little bit about this idea of being calmer, of being slower, not necessarily being as emotional about it. What are the affordances of WT social? How is WT social being built?

And talk about kind of some of the more theoretical grounding. I've become convinced that there's something deeply wrong with the advertising only business model for social media, and it's not necessarily the problems I would have predicted. As an example, as a piece of it, one of the things that's problematic today is programmatic advertising. This is the ads that follow you around on the web because they've used cookies and they figured out who you are and they give you ads that are more relevant. Let's just say at the outset, I think it's really great in certain ways. One of the ways that's really great is, wherever I go on the web, I get ads that are actually meaningful to me. I always joke it's, I get ads for boats all the time because I like boats and I read boating magazines. It's boats I can't afford, so it's like boat porn, but I click anyway.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That's fine. That's actually very good. It means that the publishers are making more money from those ads than they would if they were giving me completely random ads, which is what I used to see. There's certain things that are good about that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"However, there is something very bad about it, which is if I go to a long form piece in the Guardian, we've got some fantastic reporting that the Guardian did about Ed Snowden. I go to read a long form piece there, I see the exact same ad as if I go on Reddit, which is a very cheap to produce giant message board, which means every piece of content is competing with every other piece of content, which makes doing expensive journalism really hard. So that model isn't working.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But then there's another layer as well, which is that it means that for the social media companies, their incentives are really all about engagement, time on site, how to keep me there, keep me clicking as long as possible. You can really talk about some very simple ideas, and I'm definitely not a neuroscientist, but I don't think this is completely absurd to say: there's the monkey brain or the reptilian brain, and then there's my Aristotelian brain. My Aristotelian brain says, oh great, I've got an hour. I'm going to sit down on the internet. I'm going to do something and I'm going to become a better person ever so slightly in the next hour. Then there's the monkey brain that goes, ooh, what's that? I've got to click on that. Pretty soon the hour has been wasted, and that's a problem.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That's really driven by the business model, and I think it's very hard. When we talk about things like Facebook's efforts to rid the platform of misinformation and so forth, which I do think there are good people there who are sincerely trying to do that. I think they will find it very hard, because fundamentally it's not clear to me that their business model wants them to do that. That, in fact, the things that people ... There's the famous, I think it's XKCD comic: come to sleep, dear. I can't, someone is wrong on the internet. Somebody posting something completely ... You and I have been on the internet for a little while, and don't feed the trolls. I remember the Usenet days. But now it turns out that the algorithms are feeding the trolls, and in fact they're feeding the trolls to us, to deliver them up for us to be offended so that we click and stay longer.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Right, feeding the trolls is the business model at this point.

Actually, I think about this in the context of Google, as an example. Google, I think, has many different businesses even within just the website, nevermind Alphabet and all their other projects. But YouTube suffers from this difficulty because they struggle to make sure that their algorithm doesn't just lead people to Qanon videos, because it turns out, like rubber necking at a traffic wreck, people do that. Whereas search doesn't really have this problem, because search isn't about viral, it isn't about hang time. People go there ... Also, it's very profitable because you searched for candid camera and you get an ad. that totally makes sense, and it doesn't involve the same kind of incentives that YouTube gives them that problem.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"With WT social, one of the concepts is to say, well, look, we're not going to have ads, and we're not going to have a paywall. I joke, a series of bad business decisions, but that's how I've built my career so far. But the main reason for that is to say, now that totally resets my thinking. A lot of the metrics that you would normally really care about, you still have to think about. Let me be a little nuanced here. It's not like ... When people come to the site, my incentive is I have to give you an experience that, over a long period of time, you enjoy enough that when we say, would you chip in? You go, you know what?

But the incentive is then not to make you click every day, it's to make sure that when you come, you leave going, you know what? That was good experience. Now, I'm not sure I've achieved that yet. Part of the issue is, once you've said that, you also can't just completely ignore some basic metrics. If people are like, wow, Jimmy, this is fantastic.

I have a project that I've been working on over at the Knight First Amendment Initiative over at Columbia, trying to sort of map different types of social networks. It's funny, we always talk Facebook and Twitter. They're the two that we come back to all the time. The truth is, there's a huge wealth of things that we call social networks that are actually quite different. The third most popular category we found are question and answer networks. Things like Quora, all these different programming boards where people will put up questions and give answers, and it's a very different form of conversation, actually can be a very rich type of conversation.

The truth is, there's sociability, which covers a huge, huge range of activities. There's media, including the Zoom medium that we're using here, and there's all sorts of interesting, different ways to intersect. I love the fact that you're looking at WT social and essentially saying, look, here are some things we want. We're not doing the ad model.

Beekeeping is a hobby that is requires quite a bit of knowledge, and apparently if you're new at it, the bees die a lot, and you need people to help you.

Once a week, she's going to get on a Zoom call, only it won't be Zoom, it'll be on our platform, and she's there and just like, ask me anything. They can get together, that group, and they can talk about their bees, and they can even walk outside with the camera, go look, I don't know what's going on. Oh, your bees have this mold.

I'm hoping that you're going to tell us what's wrong with Silicon Valley and how you'd like to fix it. But I'd really love to start with asking you about a chapter title in your book, which is excellent by the way, called Stupid Environment. That environment that we're talking about here, includes this idea that these companies are in fact very, very new. It includes the fact that they are phenomenally fiscally successful, even in circumstances where they're not always profitable. That they have become enormously aspirational, both for people who want to invest in them and for people who want to work for them. They have a cultural pole as well as a fiscal pole.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The quote from Alan Kay that you used to title that chapter talks about this idea that evolution isn't necessarily about creating the best creatures. It's about creating creatures that are fit for their environment. And that if you've got a stupid environment, you're going to get a stupid creature. What do you worry about in this environment that surrounds Silicon Valley, that is evolving our companies and our internet systems in a particular way?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Wendy Liu:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yes. Yes, I like that question. I think maybe the way I would answer it is, I would say it makes Silicon Valley ... Generally, technological developments, startups, entrepreneurship, it makes it kind of lazy. Because the environment that we have is one where there is a lot of capital sloshing around, the result of many things, including neoliberal policy, a weakened labor movement, the rise of financialization. All this money that came from extracting fossil fuels from the ground, all of this money is looking for places to go. The tech industry happens to be a place where massive returns on capital are quite possible, not for everyone, but for some. So, you have all this money that is just waiting for the right entrepreneur, with a compelling pitch. What I think that does is, on that side, because access to capital is so easy, it means that you have entrepreneurs who don't necessarily have a plan or who are just kind of making it up as they go along.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's some very notable cases in point, WeWork being one, Theranos of a few years ago being another, where you don't even actually have to have anything concrete to be able to raise a lot of money and to be the darling of the media. So, I think on the one hand you have that. And then on the other hand, because we have a mode of production that is characterized by exploitation, in the sense that the vast majority of people do not have the resources to not get a job. They have to get a job because that's the only way they're going to be able to pay their bills and be able to survive. And because of that, people need to get a job. In the United States, especially, there is such a threadbare welfare state, that you don't really have resources if there aren't any great jobs in your area. So, you kind of have to take whatever job's around. No matter how stultifying, no matter how much it infringes upon your dignity or how much it injures your body, you just have to take it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think what that does, is it means that entrepreneurs do not feel compelled to innovate when it comes to making good work environments. Someone like Travis Kalanick can create a plan for creating a company where people are just driving cars around. He doesn't have to think, \\\"Well, are they going to be enjoying their jobs?\\\" That's not really a question that most of these entrepreneurs need. They don't have to cater to the desires of workers. They just have to cater to the desires of consumers. That's the driving goal of the thing they teach you in startup school, is all you have to do is care about what people want. You have to make something that consumers want. You have to make your customers happy. Customer success is Amazon's driving engine. I think on the one hand, while that has its benefits, it is also just profoundly narrow because what customers want, it's not a universal thing. It's the product of particular environments.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"As we talked about, this environment is one that may itself have its own problems. We're talking about what consumers want in an environment where society is just kind of crumbled and people are so atomized. One of the only ways people can feel fulfilled is through consumption, is through buying things, even if those things don't actually make them happy in the end, even if those things are predicated on destroying the environment and just creating tons of ecological waste. So, we're talking about making consumers happy within this quite harmful paradigm, where happiness is something that you can buy through an Instagram ad. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Just maybe zooming in for a second on something like advertising, Google and Facebook both make so much money from advertising. If we think about how the web could have turned out, if advertising were not this backbone of so many business models, well, it could actually be quite different. Companies like Google and Facebook, they might not exist, or they might be very different. They wouldn't be as profitable. I definitely think that there are ways that technology could have turned out, even within this neoliberal paradigm. Maybe it would have been harder to make this work, but in the early days of the internet, ads were not really a thing. It was probably possible, back then, to imagine a future where the internet was just not a commercial medium and where there were different ways of funding creative endeavors and content and media.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So yeah, I think there is definitely something about how the people who run these companies and who make decisions about how to fund their companies, they have a particular ideology that is intertwined with just late stage capitalist ideology in general, but isn't entirely down to that. I think part of it has to do with this idea that they're the good guys. I write about this in my book a little bit, how you have a lot of founders who seem to really think that they're the underdogs. And that because they're the underdogs, any action they take is justified because they're overthrowing some horrible overlord, whether that's, I don't know, the big banks or the hotel industry or some local politician or the unions or something. They have this image in their mind that allows themselves to rationalize whatever they do, even if they're making a decision that, maybe if they were looking at it more coldly and more rationally would think, \\\"Oh, this is probably not a good decision. This is not a moral decision.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But they've found a way to convince themselves that they are the underdogs and moreover, that they are shepherding humanity forward through time. They are the harbingers of progress, of reason and bringing all these innovations to people. So, it doesn't matter if they do something that people criticize. It doesn't matter if the media loves to criticize the tech industry because they just don't get it. They don't understand the cost of progress.

Certainly we've gotten used to the spectacle of tech CEOs standing up in front of Congress ... although, these days they do it on Zoom and being chewed out in one fashion or another. That doesn't actually seem to scare them very much. I think you and I both believe that labor organizing may be scaring them a bit more, to talk a little bit about how employees might be able to hold companies accountable to their values.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Wendy Liu:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Definitely, yeah. Maybe just to take a step back, I think the labor movement is important because it is a means of attaining leverage over capital, just more broadly. Not just in the tech industry, but at the point of production. Because if we think of capitalism as a system that allows capital accumulation to occur primarily through exploiting workers at their jobs ... not exclusively, but primarily, then how do you challenge that? Well, it's by workers collectively finding a way to say, \\\"No, we don't want this.\\\" Demanding better conditions, demanding better pay, demanding different kinds of work that they want to do.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There is a long history of labor organizing in sectors that were previously thought unorganizable, where the workers in these sectors were told that they shouldn't be organizing because they're not real workers. They're so privileged to be able to have the kind of jobs they do, that they shouldn't complain. There's a very long history of that, I think. So, it's important to remember that there is a history, when we're talking about tech worker organizing, because one of the main criticisms of the tech work organizing that has occurred recently, is that tech workers should just be grateful for having the jobs that they do and that they shouldn't complain. I think what that criticism misses is that there are many different reasons workers would want to try to build collective power. The way I think about it, there are these kind of three broad areas. One is the bread and butter issues of wages, benefits, working conditions, things like that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That's probably less common in the tech industry, but not for everyone. I mean, it depends on the kind of job you do. You can be a tech worker who doesn't actually have great pay and benefits because management doesn't think you're essential, or maybe you're discriminated against because of your gender or your race or other characteristics. I think those issues are still in play, not for all tech workers, but definitely for some. Then, you have issues like harassment. You have issues like an unsafe working environment. This is something that I think is actually very, very common in tech, especially for people who are minorities or who are just not respected in some way. That has driven quite a bit of collective action, especially at companies like Google, where there was that Andy Rubin case. There's been a long history of sexism and racism in the tech industry, that is expressed in a way that conflicts with the idea that it is a meritocracy and yet it somehow continues.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And then on the last note, I think that the really interesting reason that would drive workers to organize in tech, that I think is quite powerful and maybe we don't talk about enough, is just about the kind of work they should be doing. Because if you think about a lot of the criticisms of companies like Facebook, the criticism of Facebook, sure, there's the labor angle. There's the working conditions angle, but there's also the fact that the kind of products that Facebook is producing is maybe harmful to society. Right now, who decides what products are made? Well, it's decided at the top. The people on top aren't really accountable to Congress. They might have to show up and just answer a few questions, but it's not going to actually change their opinions very much and there's just no real accountability. One of the only ways we can get accountability is by building power at a point of leverage. One of those points of leverage is at the point of production.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Facebook would not exist, Facebook would not continue to have new features being built without the people who work on it. That includes everyone from content moderators to the software engineers who are working on products, to people who work in marketing, people who clean the office, Ethan. You have a whole range of people who are involved in Facebook and who are Facebook workers, whether or not they're employed by Facebook directly or they're employed through a third party vendor, like Adecco or something else. I think it's important to recognize that all of these workers have the same interests, insofar as not just how they're being paid and what their conditions at work are, but also, what are they working on? What, at the end of the day, are they spending their time on?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"People want to be proud of what they've worked on. They don't want to feel like they're working on something that is making the world worse. The problem right now, is that they don't actually have any power as individual workers to challenge this, unless they happen to be the very top of the reporting chain. But an individual worker, who just joins, has really no say, has no way of exerting whatever they actually want. The end result is, you end up with a world that is dictated by Mark Zuckerberg and his pals.

It feels to me like you have an enormous problem at a company like Facebook, where it probably feels very, very different to be a young engineer recruited for six plus figures. Certainly, working very, very hard, but to see yourself as being the same employee of Facebook as someone who's in Manila, working an overnight shift on content moderation. You're both working for Facebook, but it's hard to get that vision of solidarity to embrace the two. Similarly, if you're doing product selection algorithms on Amazon, how much kinship, how much solidarity do you feel with someone who is filling boxes in a warehouse in Iowa City?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One possibility for it is that sense of, we both want to work for a company that we feel good about. But as you pointed out, that's actually one of the hardest things, unless you're quite senior in the chain of this. Talk to me a little bit about some of the efforts that we've actually seen ongoing. Prop 22 in California, which has passed and created potentially, quite a different environment for \\\"independent contractors\\\" like Uber drivers, who are now being treated differently or the Google workers' union. How are these sort of changing the terms of debate within Silicon Valley?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Wendy Liu:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Mm, yeah. The fight against Prop 22 is really interesting because I think what Prop 22 amounts to is a legislative effort to enshrine a different classification of worker. There are Uber software engineers who would have preferred to call their drivers coworkers. It was never up to them. It was never up to the drivers, over whether those changes would be made. That was entirely a top-down effort, to enshrine this kind of classification. It was very frustrating that it passed. Though not surprising, given how much money they spent, over 200 million, I believe, along with other companies. I think the Alphabet Workers Union is quite exceptional and innovative, in that it is trying to reach across the lines of job category. It's saying because they're a minority union, they aren't legally limited to only actual Alphabet employees. They can reach out to contractors. They can reach out to people down the value chain. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, I think that is really exciting. But yeah, to your point, it's difficult to build solidarity among people who have different jobs and who are working in different cities, different countries, with very different kinds of environments. I think that is really, really hard. I don't think it's going to be easy in any way. But at the same time, when you look at labor history, you see so many examples of very similar kinds of differences that were bridged, in the sense of if you look at labor organizing that took place in industries that had segregation. You had legally ensuring racial segregation, where maybe if you were black, you were only allowed to work a certain job. This is just kind of convention. That definitely made it hard to organize, but there have been very illustrious and exciting cases where the workers were able to cross that racial gap and say, \\\"Well, even if society keeps us apart, even if we don't necessarily like each other, we do recognize that for strategic reasons, it is helpful if we band together. Because as long as we're divided, then our employer wins. They can do whatever they want to us. But if we come together, even though it might be difficult to overcome these societal barriers, but still, there is so much more power in uniting and building solidarity.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, I think it's useful to think of collective action through a strategic lens and not just through a moral lens, because it's not just about building solidarity to feel good about yourself, although that might be part of it. It's also recognizing that this may be the only way to achieve what you want. While that sounds nice, I think there's a special barrier in the higher echelons in the tech industry, where there's a particular culture that is profoundly anti-solidaristic. It's very much based on the idea of individual merit and that you only got there because you're so good. I think it's hard for people who've grown up with that narrative and who have maybe used it as a crutch \\u2014 I'm speaking of myself, of course, too \\u2014 who've maybe used it as a crutch just get through life. It's hard to discard that. It's hard to suddenly say, \\\"Okay, maybe I was wrong. Maybe this whole meritocracy thing doesn't actually work the way I thought it did,\\\" and to instead find a new kind of identity, rooted in solidarity.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think that's really hard to do. But I do think that it is a crucial step of just being realistic about how the world works and recognizing that no, capitalism is not this meritocracy that is designed to give the best people all the money. It's instead, grounded in very different principles, that have very little to do with actual merit in any sort of universal sense and more based on, are you going to produce value for those the people who are already in power?

They think, \\\"Well, I enjoy building software, but could I do it in a way that doesn't destroy society in the process and make a few people extremely wealthy?\\\" I think the idea of a cooperative, in many forms, including a more community-centered one or one that's just a work cooperative or a platform cooperative ... There are many different ways of structuring it, but I think the general idea is that, you have a company or organization of some sort that is owned equally by all the people affected. That doesn't just have one person who reaps all the reward, but is instead, this kind of community project. It is stewarded jointly and for the benefit of the community.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"For example, instead of Uber, you can imagine a platform cooperative that is maybe owned by the drivers and the people who build it. There are examples of this already.  There are definitely examples of existing food delivery cooperatives and rideshare cooperatives all over the world, that are just trying to figure out this business model. It's hard for them because the investment isn't necessarily there. There's not that much money that wants to go into a co-op, knowing that they're not going to get a 10X return. But I think that it's a much more satisfying and fulfilling way of running a company or building something and one that's rooted in knowing that you are trying to serve a community and that you're actually accountable to the people that you want to be accountable to.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What about from the perspective of people like you? You became a coder at a young age.

I know that my students at MIT and I suspect also at UMass, often find themselves looking at these big corporations and telling themselves this story, \\\"Well, these things are so powerful. If I can do some good from within there, how can I change the world?\\\" What advice would you give to a young person who's trying to decide, what's the balance between working for one of these very large companies and also wanting to have a clear sense of social responsibility and social change?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Wendy Liu:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's more than one path to succeeding as an engineer or technologist or whatever you are.

I think it's actually kind of crucial to find alternative ways of seeking validation and seeking success, than just climbing up the career ladder of one of these big companies because these companies, they don't actually care about social responsibility any more than... They'll put out a sentence about it or whatever in their quarterly filings, but they don't actually care. They can't. The stock market won't allow them to care about it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, I think it's worth recognizing that there are these institutional limits, there are these structural limits on what you can achieve as an individual.

Am I going to find another job, that's hopefully better, even though there aren't that many? Am I going to just do something else entirely and kind of go off the beaten path?\\\" I think it's a great time to go off the beaten path, because there are a lot of other people who are in the same boat. I don't think the tech industry is going to get better overnight. I think it's going to get a lot worse and a lot more demoralizing before it gets better. I would definitely encourage people who are in it or thinking about joining it, to just consider the limitations of what they can do by doing their job according to the spec.

So emphasizing that we really can't just look at the internet in isolation. And yeah, so a bit of background. So my activism research and intellectual community building has focused on the way people work online for a long time, longer than I care to remember. So in 2014, I suggested bringing the worker co-op model to the digital economy, asking what it would be like if you had an Uber that would be owned by its drivers on Airbnb, that would be owned by its residents. And that had an enormous resonance. And two books followed and many conferences at The New School. Now, we have a research Initiative that focuses on the cooperative digital economy. Just welcomed seven new PhD students that focus on that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And several political parties have made that platform cooperative isn't part of their political platform, like the Social Democrats in Germany, the Labour Party in the UK, under the previous and current leadership, and also the legislative assembly in Kerala, India. So we have some 500 projects in 47 countries right now, ranging in sectors from domestic care, to home delivery, agriculture. Also some work in short-term rentals and e-hailing and also social media. So there, I think it's sort of a split screen between digital labor practices and also cooperative internet infrastructure. And I think Ethan, I think this is just such a... While this, we just talked about this a minute ago, has not been an easy year, but this is really a truly cooperative moment. On the one hand, there's this atmosphere of emergency, that's used to push a politics of austerity.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And then there's the sort of rhetoric of a return to normalcy propagated by establishment politicians as a sort of simple way of trying to control this moment at a peace, everybody who wants to imagine and build a different future. But then I think historically, when you look at exactly moments like that, when safety nets that were provided by governments or communities or families for part, this is exactly the moment is tightly when co-ops emerged. And so it's not so surprising that we had a real increase in interest in this work with the last year.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So let's back up a little bit and talk about sort of two different kinds of platform cooperatives. So when we use this term \\\"platform,\\\" we can mean fairly different things. So there's one branch of the internet in which what we're often talking about are, or what economists sometimes call, two-sided markets. You have providers of services, you have consumers of services, you try to match them up. Airbnb, Uber. Those both might fall into that space. And the platforms view themselves as quote unquote, neutral providers, matching buyers and sellers. And you and I think would both agree that they are far from neutral.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's also platforms in the sense that we tend to talk about social media platforms, which is they are service providers that are allowing people to share information online, connect with each other in different ways. And they are being matched involuntarily with advertisers who want their attention in order to sort of pay for those things. Let's take the two in turn. How do platform cooperatives alter both of those models? What does platform cooperativism look like in building an alternative to an Uber or an Airbnb?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Trebor Scholz:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think it's not the right framing, because so often at events or you in conversations, I guess that's sort of just a natural place to go, just to say like, \\\"So can this be or how is this an alternative to Uber, Google, Apple, Amazon?\\\" But what we find actually, and also historically, when you look at the history of cooperatives, that's not really what co-ops have done. They haven't really replaced large corporations. And when you look at something like smartDOT co-op, it's a platform co-op that has offers an employment status to freelancers, thereby affording them unemployment insurance, health insurance, et cetera. You see, I don't want to go too far into it, but just to show that this is something very specific to the co-op structure, it has really hardly anything to do with these big tech companies.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And yet, it's present in nine European countries, has 35,000 members, and it's quite important. That's why I think that... If you look at Italian community cooperatives, I think they might be the best way to think about what can happen on the internet. Think of an Italian village in the mountains. So hundreds of years old and people are leaving. And so now people have to think about how they get their sick to the hospital, how they run the postal service, and how they run the restaurant so that tourists come into the hotel. And so they are forming community cooperatives to do all these things at once. And I'm just extremely fascinated and inspired by this, which is not directly talking about platform co-ops, but I think it serves the needs that are just underserved by the government or by communities or individuals.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So this is what I said often with many of these platform cooperatives, they find very particular areas in which they, they serve the needs of people. In care, in-home care, in-home delivery services. For example, and also Italy, Italy is on my mind today, I guess. The city of Polonia just launched a platform co-op. And the way they went about it is very different than what we are used to from Deliveroo or Uber Eats or places like that, where they surveyed 150 people in the community, in the midst of the pandemic, asking them what they need. From the store owner, to the libraries, from the bread factory, to the unions, to the cooperatives.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And they found that, yes, they needed delivery services. So what came out was an home delivery service, but thought about and framed in a way very differently to anything else we've seen in the United States, which is they bring books to people's houses from the library. They thought about staying with elder, with pensioners, and talking to them because they are so socially isolated. They pick up food, they deliver bread in the morning to the restaurants and also deliver pizza, but it's much more just it's it came out of the needs of the whole ecosystem, not just the workers. I thought that was really interesting.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So the point being that platform cooperatives are not just Uber Eats that happened to be owned by the participants within the system, platform cooperatives are a different way of going about solving a set of social problems. Is that right?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Trebor Scholz:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. And when you think of sort of how Nissenbaum's idea of a value sensitive design, so it really responds also in the design of the platforms uniquely to the challenges. Think of Up n' go co-operative in New York City, which has realized that worker profiles are really just there to pit workers against one another. And I found this extremely unuseful. So they just got rid of that when they designed the app and said \\\"Basically no worker profiles for us.\\\" When I talked to women, when we were starting a platform co-op in Ahmedabad in Gujarat with the SEWA Federation, we spoke to the women and I asked them what kind of ideas they would have for an app. And these are women who did have not much idea of this world at all. They knew WhatsApp and a little bit of Facebook. The first thing was an arm went up and said like \\\"No worker profiles.\\\" So you see how they are not just copying these companies, they are really quite can be very unique. Yeah.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Can you talk a little bit about how platform cooperatives are working in terms of social media or digital spaces?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Trebor Scholz:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, absolutely. So there basically is a movement, but to create a decentralized peer to peer services. There's a lot of experimentation with co-operative data ownership. There are projects like MyData in Switzerland, which created co-operative patient data ownership, which is then where the patient has the opportunity to release the data to their doctor for free, but perhaps to a for-profit research Initiative at a pay, as at a fee, which is then donated to public research. So it's not that anybody makes money from that. There's an expectation with data trusts. So I wrote a research paper for Sidewalk Labs together with Jutta Treviranus from the Inclusive Research Design Center in Toronto, where we proposed the cooperative data trust for the Sidewalk Labs project, which were essentially allow the people, the residents of this area, to govern the data that are collected on them, and to decide in the first place, much along the lines of the work we saw in Barcelona around data sovereignty, to really that people can also decide which data are actually collected in the first place.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So this question of data trusts and data unions gets into interesting waters very quickly because there's some group of people essentially warning that allowing the collection of data and the possibility of its resale. You offered a very innocuous example, which is to use aggregated data for medical research. Once we get into things like tracking data, data that's used for ad targeting and things like that, there's at the same time, people arguing for decentralized platforms precisely to sort of get rid of that data. This, for me, raises this really interesting question. Is data something that we should be valuing and trying to figure out how to get compensated for our collective data? Or is it something that we should be sort of protecting from exposure? Should we be turning it into an asset or should we be something trying to stop the idea of it being commoditized in that way?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Trebor Scholz:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, one thing, I think where there's a unique opportunity for cooperatives sort of giving a maybe roundabout answer to your question is that the cooperative community is organized around the seven cooperative principles. One of is that cooperatives benefit other cooperatives and work to the benefit of other cooperatives. So you have that essentially enshrined in this work, which really opens the gates to shared data standards and a data commons, where cooperatives worldwide could share their data. And I think this is also maybe an answer that's really more urgent to a lot of people in this movement is how can you actually scale this? And one way to scale it is we've found over the last few years at most of these cooperatives work best when they stay local and are relatively small, but then federate, and have a shared digital infrastructure.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So you see this, for example, with CoopCycle in France, which has established a software for delivery cooperatives in Europe. So they work with 47 cooperatives, they're all quite small and they have open-source software that these cooperatives can use. And so in that sense, the data could be shared and bring the benefit right to this, and also create an entity that could actually compete in the market, through Federation, by creating networks. You see this similarly in India where the SEWA Federation has this large number, I think it's 115 cooperatives, in its Federation, while also being a union at the same time with 1.4 million people working together to benefit as an ecosystem, as an ecosystem, the self-employed poor women in India. So you see how this sort of how the opportunities for data commons are kind of obvious there, to share data to the benefit of all members.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's two ideas there that we end up sort of talking a lot on, on this show and in some of the discussions that we've been having. The first one is the notion of small and federated, because this is very much what people are now sort of proposing for alternative social media spaces. It's very, very difficult to imagine social media spaces where we all create our own incompatible software. It's much more likely that we're going to have some basic standards, some open-source packages, and the ability to federate between those systems, at minimum around things like identity, the ability to sort of move in and out of each other's spaces.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The other one that seems critical is that when you have sufficiently small spaces, it's probably easier for the communities to be involved with actually managing them. And this to me seems like one of the critical failures in these very large scale platforms, whether the transactional platforms like Uber or the social media platforms like Facebook, is that the people who are using these systems have essentially no voice and authority on how they're carried out. When we get systems that are much smaller, the problem of governance becomes more tractable, which not only has the chance of those platforms being fairer, but also has all sorts of positive externalities, like people sort of participating within governance. What are lessons learned from a platform cooperativism about how groups learn how to govern themselves?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Trebor Scholz:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That's the central... I mean, amazing question there. The larger these cooperatives get, the harder it is to really offer democratic governance, a lift democratic governance. And also a feeling of these members actually to be really part of this organization. And well, how do they solve it? How do people start to solve these issues is with tools like Lumeo, from Enspiral in New Zealand. And through participatory processes to really try to engage. And also frankly, tell people about the co-op model. So there are many large platforms where people just realize like, \\\"Well, this platform just pays much better than the others, so that's why they are there.\\\" And then they are learning that governance might also be a part of the picture and that this is actually a co-operative. Example I mentioned earlier smart.coop in Europe, and then also in Canada, Stocksy United is a platform for stock photography and video.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And it has around a thousand photographers. It's incredibly competitive and made, I think they had a revenue of like $13 million last year. But so it's quite successful in many ways, but they also found they paid twice as much or more than twice as much. It's the highest paid service, I think, actually in that industry for your images, for stock photography. But then to really operate this as a cooperative is not easy. So on the backend, they have an educational portal, which is really interesting because sort of triggering out these or teasing out these differences, education is another one that's also specific to cooperatives that they educate their members. Getty Images couldn't care less if they-\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"They probably don't want you to understand the financial model behind it, whereas cooperatives absolutely require you to understand how it works.

I want more platform cooperatives in my life.\\\" Are there platform that people can join other than the sort of highly geographic, highly local ones that we've been largely talking about? People often sort of come out of a discussion like this and sort of say, \\\"I want to try a decentralized social network,\\\" and then sign up for Mastodon.

We have a mailing list and newsletter and all of that. But earlier this year, we partnered with Mondragon University, and the platform called Consortium. And now we started offering an online course together on platform co-ops. And in the summer, 1,000 people asked to be registered from over 40 countries. And this is now still running, so now in the second edition. And it's a wonderful way of getting an introduction to this topic. And then in the second half of the course, actually incubate your own idea in collaboration with local partners.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So we have over 40 local organizations around the world that incubate with participants in their local language.

And in the first edition, we also had a Korean track and then all the lectures were translated in all these languages. So it's a good way to start because the most amazing thing about it is that the people get to know each other.

We're also thinking about conversions. So what would it be like to convert something like care.com into a cooperative? In fact, right now, my colleague Nathan Schneider's converting sort of non-profits and to cooperatives, which is also an important area there. And yeah, it's essentially to scale it with Mondragon, I think, to really reach into the cooperative movement worldwide and continue these experiments, create incubators, reaching.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I mean, we're already reaching tens of thousands of people, but to grow beyond that and really create jobs that are probably, in my opinion, not predominantly competing with these large, big companies. We saw projects like that not do incredibly well, but in New York City, we actually have one underway, which looks incredibly promising. It's the drivers co-operative, which aims to be a tertiary service in this area. But then Ethan, this also doesn't just apply to these particular areas. We are also thinking about higher education. We are thinking about, what can you do with the some 60 million artisans in India? Could you create a cooperative marketplace for them?

And then going back to, I think, one of the earlier episodes that I listened to also, cooperative music streaming. So I spoke with Resonate, the CEO of Resonate just a few days ago. And I think one of the big contributions, and I think this is what is so important to get across, is I remember this conversation. I was at a business conference in Madrid in this very fancy hotel. And in the breakout session, I was talking with an economist who writes for the New York Times and shall remain unnamed. And I asked him about this, \\\"So what do you think of cooperatives?\\\" And he literally looked at me and said, \\\"Insignificant part of the GDP,\\\" and turned around and walked off. And maybe, sure.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"When you look at the data, Finland, the Netherlands, have around 10% of the GDP, but those numbers can be contested. Might be more like 3% or 4%, even there. But I think what's really important to understand what is actually the value proposition of these projects? And I think that's part for the sort of big vision. What are they actually contributing? they contribute something very different. When I talked to the Resonate founder just a few days ago, he described to me how it's a relatively small cooperative, some 2000 members, but it really creates a culture. It contributes a culture of music for fans and musicians, a sort of social network in which they are connected, but it's a very different value proposition. That's hard to quantify.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"When I talked to the recent immigrant who works for Up & Go, she describes how the dignity that she receives from working for this cooperative, the dignity that changes the way she feels in her everyday life.

I think there's also another potential, which is really the fact that this is not just about economic activity, but also about the possibility of connecting distributed workers in the sense that if you go back to the 1880s, where there was with the Knights of Labor, there's, historically of course, this deep connection between cooperatives and unions. Also, they emerged in the same place almost at the same time. North of England, 1844 in Rochdale. So you had guilds forming into unions and you had these sort of first co-operative, not the first, but the most recognizable co-operatives emerge. So lots of parallels there as well. So they can also increase the association of power of workers. Freelancers, let's say, that are distributed, and which unions have fairly insufficiently addressed or protected.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I'm curious, we've been trying to sort of define a set of almost what we're calling like a civic logic, for sort of thinking about if you were to redesign something like a social network with principles that this is a network designed for strengthening ties between people, that it's designed to make people more powerful as citizens and as neighbors, and more accountable, one another, that these networks have to be involved with their own governance. They can't sort of outsource it to third parties. Is there a set of logics that you can imagine as a set of cooperative values that could sort of inform technical design, even of platforms that are not setting up co-ops? Are there lessons to be learned from platform co-ops around the value sphere or is it really a parallel economic model?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Trebor Scholz:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, I think it's... I mean, first of all, it's about ownership. I mean, you can't fully control what you don't own, and I think that's a lesson. I think there's a real competitive advantage of platform crops to other businesses where they can say to users and workers that \\\"We can actually control your privacy to a much fuller extent because we own the platform.\\\" But then it's also about inclusive design and co-design, so that these projects, that the people you want to end up with, are really part of this project from day one.

You can imagine, for instance, those delivery services being set up during times of COVID. Some of them that could be set up and administered either by a federal government or a local government. Is there a danger that instead of solving our problems through co-ops that we are sort of letting the government off the hook yet again, and sort of accepting a level of government failure that we then have to make up for as individual citizens? Shouldn't we be demand some of these services as public services?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Trebor Scholz:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, Ethan, I think everything at once. We should demand them and we should also help the people who, for the past, not help the people, but supporting people who help themselves already. That over the past 50 years, the failed politics of the past 50 years, that has not sufficiently addressed economic inequality with the American worker since 1972, 1978, in that range. Their wages, if adjusted for inflation, haven't really increased, while their productivity has vastly increased. Who is watching out for them? Who is watching out for them? I spoke yesterday with an infectious disease nurse from Seattle who, in the most emotional terms ever, complained to me and basically says she doesn't know where to turn because the United States healthcare system is so broken. I mean, she likened it to genocide. And therefore, turned to my course on platform cooperatives, because she said like \\\"Well, what else should we do?\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I mean, we need to help ourselves. It's a similar move you saw with the Zapatistas. It's a similar move that you see all over the world. I mean, this is how even in the United States, rural electric cooperatives, which have now 40 million members in the United States, that association, that cover, I think, 41% of the American grid, is cooperatively owned. So there's a reason for that. So because of the vast failure of the system. And so this should not prevent us from pushing for participatory democracy as much of an ideal and however unrealized that may have ever been.

We have problems that have not adequately been solved by the public sector. Cooperatives, at that point, offer another vision for going ahead and doing this. There's a lot of really interesting thinking here, and it's wonderful to have the resource of your course to turn to. Trebor, this has really been a pleasure.

The first is that you're doing it with real communities that are actually out there in the world, they're live, people are using them right now, and platforms have different levels of governance control.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Reddit, as you referenced, actually gives you a good deal of control at the moderator level. And if the moderator decided that she wanted to hand over the reins to the community, there's really good ways to do that. So the first thing I love about it is, is that it's real.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The second thing I love about it is that rather than assuming that every community wants to have a giant long drag-out discussion about how they should govern themselves, we might actually start with some models and paradigms that work for a lot of communities and let people sort of tune them and choose them from there. Do you have a sense for what people want to do with a tool like PolicyKit? Do you have sort of users who are telling you we want to use it for these specific purposes?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Amy Zhang:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. So, I think we are kind of starting that initial process of doing field studies and interviews with communities, but there has been a lot of research already on online communities and sort of the struggles that they face with issues like moderator burnout, legitimacy crises that happened within the community, community splintering for various reasons, difficulty with understanding the norms of the community or dealing with newcomers.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So I think all of these are common issues that any community can run into. And I think another thing here is that communities have all kind of learned this on their own, right? When you signed up to be a moderator of a Facebook group and it blows up and becomes a hundred thousand members, you don't have a PhD in governance to be able to know how to manage this community.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And so you're learning by trial and error. And I think part of the power of having a place where people can kind of try these things out and learn from each other is that you don't have to do this all necessarily on your own.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I find myself wondering whether we're going to end up with almost a curriculum for teaching people moderator skills and sort of maybe not providing the PhD in content moderation or internet community, but at least the master's level degree. I know that I teach Jillian Dibbell's article A Rape in Cyberspace to try to get people to wrestle with this question of it's just words versus well, words are what the reality is made out of therefore, words are real.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"How are you teaching your students when you're now leading people through this process of thinking about designing this, what are things that people should read before trying to build tools for communities or before trying to lead communities?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Amy Zhang:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So it's funny that you ask that question because I just gave a guest lecture on the topic of content moderation to an undergraduate kind of a lower level class. So these are freshmen and sophomores learning about data structures. And one of their assignments is to build a toxicity classifier and I take them through basically the assumptions that they're making when building such a tool and then zooming out to sort of the implications of those assumptions on the community, on society, on individual users of these tools.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Amy Zhang:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And then kind of trying to question those. So like, what does it mean if you deploy a toxicity model across the platform of millions of people, all with different ideas about what is toxicity and different cultural norms? What does it mean when you've now set up a system where there are contract laborers who need to be looking at and labeling this data to feed your classifier and in perpetuity, right?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, I think there are just so many interesting and also difficult questions about how to design such rules. And I think that's sort of the first thing, which is just to insert those questions into students' minds. And then after that, there's just so much literature out there.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, Amy, my favorite project of yours and there's a lot of projects, so it's hard to sort of pick a favorite, but I think the one that I ended up talking about the most when I talk about your work is \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"SquadBox\"), \", can you talk a little bit about that project? And I hope then to tell our listeners why I love it so much and why I think it's so important.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Amy Zhang:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, absolutely. So \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"SquadBox\"), \" is a project that we started, that was aimed at people who are dealing with online harassment. And the way we started the project was that we went out and we interviewed lots of people who do deal with online harassment in a lot of different ways. For their work as a teacher, as a scientist, an activist.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Also, people dealing with ex partners who are harassing them. So a wide range of folks, and we've found a couple of things. We found that first people have very different ideas about what is harassment to them and how they would like to deal with harassment. And the second thing that we found, which was really interesting was that the most common technique that people used to respond to harassment was to actually give their password over to their friend or forward along something that was potentially harassing to a trusted individual.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And then that person would then come in and help the person who was getting harassed, be able to manage that harassment, such as, deleting things, reporting things, responding to the harasser, all these different things. And, we saw that in action and we thought, people are doing this in a kind of hacky way. They're going around how the system is designed, giving out their passwords to their friends, for instance, to be able to do this, what would it mean to actually design a system that can support this behavior and support the ability for people to be able to help each other when they're in distress.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And so that was where the idea of \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"SquadBox\"), \" was born. And it's a very simple idea that when you are dealing with harassment, that you have the ability to turn to your trusted friends, to who can then come in and according to your sort of needs and specifications, be able to help you deal with that harassment in the ways that I mentioned.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What are some of the lessons learned that have come from sort of using this in the real world? Are people using this as an active system?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Amy Zhang:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, it's an active tool. It's out there at \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"SquadBox\"), \".org, I think is the email or the URL. And then you can also have an @\", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"SquadBox\"), \".org email as well. So, I think this work is really interesting to me because I think it is a demonstration of a lot of other things that platforms could potentially do to put more power into the hands of users of the platform to be able to customize their experiences on the platform.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I think this is incredibly important. I think this model of sort of one software design to fit everybody, one community guideline that can just handle millions, sometimes billions of people, one algorithm to be able to define what is harassment to everyone is just not possible, I guess.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I think that there is a lot that needs to be done with regards to localization, customization, personalization of people's experiences, to match up with their reality of how they see things. And I think that harassment was one case of that. And we're now exploring kind of additional tools to kind of support people in that behavior.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think it's important to realize that when you put more things onto the user, it's not sort of transferring responsibility or transferring labor. I don't want to think of it that way. I think it needs to be an act of empowerment to these users. And so to do that, there are ways to design tools to actually support them in that and to allow them to support each other in that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think it's also not necessarily a solitary activity. So, one of our latest projects, which we're still kind of ongoing in our lab is thinking about, could end users, just everyday people on these platforms actually be able to build their own machine learning classifiers and be able to have these powerful, automated tools that are out there that platforms use to kind of apply to everyone and instead shift it so that people can use them to be able to do the things they need to do on these platforms.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So you're really asking this question of how could we give the users more agency, particularly when they're working on the platforms. As you know, this is a problem that I'm really obsessed with as well. The work that we did around Gobo was all about trying to figure out how to put more of that into the user's hands.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Unlike me, you've published papers about this and win awards and get top papers at a bunch of the best conferences around this. How are platforms reacting? Do you find that people within Facebook or YouTube are calling you up to sort of talk about these strategies? Do you think it's having an influence on them? What's the relationship with being a top UX academic at an industry where these questions, I would think really have to be hot topics for everybody sort of involved with the field?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Amy Zhang:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think that it depends on the topic and the sensitivity of the topic at times. So I think that oftentimes major platforms are afraid of relinquishing power to users and sort of allow these sub platform level collective activities to happen sometimes. In some cases, it can be an interesting experiment and perhaps something that even eventually makes it to the platform tool, like tools for moderators for instances is a place where you've seen changes and improvements in the software tooling.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But other aspects, I think platforms are afraid and maybe they're doing experiments, but they're not sort of pushing these things out to the wider audience yet. So one example here is we have a project that we're looking at in terms of crowdsourcing misinformation review. So, how easy is it for people to be able to determine whether something is misinformation or not? And could this actually be something that people on a platform could be doing for each other? And also, that experts for instance, could have a place on the platform to be able to be providing these services and that people could then subscribe to them.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman:\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Amy, talk to me about your theory of change, right?

I think the main thing that I'm interested in is sort of injecting more ideas into the conversation and breaking out of the mold that we have of just a few platforms with a few ideas and designs for how things work and in the future, hopefully seeing a rich tapestry of different ways that people can have communications and can form communities together in the way that they want.

My favorite was a letter sent by the principal of a school district to parents, reminding them that while their kid is on Zoom School, they should probably be wearing clothing, if they're going to pass through the background of the Zoom Room, that while it's fine to smoke a joint at home, perhaps not smoking one, the size of a Cuban cigar while your child is trying to study. It really has been a moment where we've all had some insight into people's lives.

Chicago's Experimental Sound Studios, curated a live stream series called the Quarantine Concerts, which ended up being hosted by jazz and avant-garde, non-profits and clubs, and just to every American city that you can name running every single night, basically from April through June, raising over $100,000 in donations for performers who lost gigs and tours.

One of the musicians I've seen, two or three dozen times in person is Robyn Hitchcock, who is a wonderfully quirky singer songwriter, sort of out of the Syd Barrett hallucinogenic-style of stream of consciousness songwriting. He and his partner, Emma Swift have been performing weekly on StageIt. It's a platform that I hadn't seen before this year, but it's actually a lovely idea. You buy tokens for of 10 cents a piece. You have a suggested donation to see the show. It's usually suggested at five bucks, then people tip after each song and there's a live chat going on at the same time. For someone like Hitchcock, who tell stories between sets takes crazy requests it's kind of perfect. I mean, the way that you actually want to see this guy is feeling like he's sitting with you in your living room, and then you are literally sitting in your living room.

Right around the time the pandemic started, Bandcamp started waiving its own fees the first Friday of every month. So, 100% of the money that's someone paid for the album minus the PayPal or credit card fees would go directly to the artist. Around the time that the protest movements, spurred by the murder of church, George Floyd broke out, a group of people got together and made a big Google sheet, listing every single black musician they could find on Bandcamp, so that come the first Friday of the month, you could to directly financially support black people by buying their music. This turned into a website. You can visit it, blackbandcamp.info.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It's a wonderful repository of just about every black person on Bandcamp across the world.

It's a really wonderful example, one, of the power of supporting other people's music with money, which means it can help them continue to make music they love, and two, actually finding a way to financially support and lift up our black community members, which, hey, I'll tell you, in music, basically means supporting the people who innovate every major type of music that we love. That's how it's been for the entire 20th century. That's how it is now. It's exceedingly rare that the black people who made this happen, actually get the credit and the payment that they deserve.

We're seeing a lot of indices come up of black-owned bookstores, other black-owned small businesses, particularly as we're in the holiday season. Looking for those sites is a great way to go. It's also a nice moment to shout out Bandcamp, which is trying very hard to be orders of magnitude less evil than some of the other music platforms out there. One of the guests I hope that we'll get on, in the spring is my neighbor, Joe Holt, who actually wrote a good deal of the technical architecture for Bandcamp, who can talk a little bit about how that project came about.

She is a phenomenally talented player period. Not just for.10 or 11 years old, she's a really good player. She has this wonderful habit of screaming when she takes on a drum roll and she took on Nirvana's In Bloom and plays this. What's wonderful about this is someone passed it on to Dave Grohl, who'd actually drummed on that track with Nirvana. He's not a media guy, but it got passed to him by Butch Vig, the famous producer.

It's now the leading authority on COVID data. It grew to that, just through a classic internet story, through social media, through crowdsourcing. Now they have their own website.

This is Ethan Zuckerman, your host. I'm here today with Liz Pelly, who's a journalist and media critic who's published everywhere from Rolling Stone, the Guardian Pitchfork, NPR, the New York Times. She often writes for the Baffler where she's a contributing editor and she writes a great deal about the impact of streaming services and platform technologies on music. She's got deep, deep roots, not only with the DIY scene in Boston and New York as a member of the silent barn collective, but also with the alternative media in sort of Indy weekly space. And lately she's someone who's really sort of opening my eyes to the way that the audio web and sort of Spotify in particular are trying very hard to reshape the world of music online. So Liz, so happy to have you here. I want to ask you the uncomfortable question we ask everybody, which is what's wrong with the internet, or in this case the music and audio web, and what should we do about it?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Liz Pelly\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Thank you so much for having me. Yeah, it's really interesting. I think that when you think about the problems with, I think this phrase you use the audio web, that's really interesting. It's not something I've heard before. When I think about the problems of music technology or the way that music exists online, it's really the same problems that we see elsewhere on the internet. Increasingly, the world of music online is controlled by a small handful of corporations that care more about their own bottom lines and their own profits then they do about the individuals and communities whose work circulates on their platform. And increasingly, the world of music is beholden to these small group of companies like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, YouTube, that really aren't concerned with the long-term health of music communities.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So let's back up a little bit and talk a bit about how we got here, right? So there was this digital shift where music labels went from being these immensely profitable businesses selling us plastic or vinyl discs to a business that looked like it was going to evaporate entirely because we were all going to share MP3s on Napster and no one was going to make any money anymore. And we had this sort of stretch of time where musicians, in some ways, became volunteers and everybody had a Patrion and was sort of finding a way to make their living between gigging and donations, but now it feels like the money's back in the space. There are these huge players in the space. What led to sort of the rise of these major companies, and particularly Spotify, as sort of controlling figures within the music space or, and hey, I just coined the term the audio web, but let's use it, the audio web?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Liz Pelly\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah. Well, there's a lot of different ways that different individuals and groups like to characterize what has happened within music over the past several decades. And one of these prevailing myths I think that has really propped up the streaming economy is this idea that they have saved the music industry and returned music to profitability, but the problem with the streaming economy is that similar to how the music industry has always existed, there's a really small group of major labels and celebrity artists that profit in the system and all other artists like continue struggling. Just because there's a greater amount of money being made by music doesn't mean that wealth is being trickling down to your average working independent artist or local musician. Yeah, yeah, totally. So the issues continue to exist, but there has been this narrative that has been pushed that streaming has been the sort of saving grace for our music, which it has not been. It actually, the streaming platforms, they carry out all of the same ways of creating value that other social media platforms do.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What we've seen in the streaming era is a rise of streaming services as gatekeepers that control which music gets heard and not heard. It's not this democratic process determining who succeeds and who fails in the streaming era. It's a lot of major label artists because major labels own significant shares in companies like Spotify. And through the licensing deals that they have with these companies, they're guaranteed certain advertising spaces and promotional partnerships and stuff like that. So when you open a streaming service and you look at the front page, what you're seeing is very influenced by the same economic and power interests that have always controlled the music industry. At the same time, there's also a rise of what I've referred to in articles as streambait.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Similar issues that you have to like how clickbait has affected the journalism sphere, there's different types of music that streaming services are really concerned with boosting engagement on their platform the same way that a platform like Facebook is concerned with engagement on its own platform. So they're really concerned with prioritizing music that will stream well or that people will play in the background and not really give a second thought to... Just stuff that people will just stream and stream and stream. So that has affected what types of artists can succeed on these platforms.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What do you think about this question of Spotify and other players in the podcast space as publishers?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Liz Pelly\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The article that I wrote about podcasting for the Baffler that came out this week was, the point of it was mostly to look at how musicians have struggled in the streaming environment and should try to say, \\\"Hey, a lot of the same things that musicians have dealt with for the past decade are issues that podcasters are going to start facing as the streaming companies that musicians have already had to deal with are starting to be more centralized powers in the world of podcasting and news.\\\" The subhead of the article is the media is learning what musicians already know. Spotify only works for the stars. So I have spent a lot more time thinking about the music world. And I think that in some ways, what I'm trying to suggest is in the article, I say, \\\"Musicians have always been like canaries in the coal mine in terms of how media trends go.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And the past couple of months, I feel like I saw a lot of critics sort of trying to parse whether Spotify is the YouTube of podcasts or whether it's the Netflix of podcasts. And I just kept thinking Spotify is the Spotify of podcasts. They're doing all the same stuff that musicians have dealt with. And I think that people are trying to figure out what to do in podcasting would be well advised to tune into what musicians have been screaming about for the past decade. I think that there's a lot to be learned. And in terms of music, I don't think it's a question of will we come up with alternatives for the music world?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It's we have to because currently there aren't a lot of options for non-major label artists to make a living or sometimes not even make a living. Just not be exploited in terms of how they distribute their music online. And there have been some signs over the past few years of new methods and practices that have been gaining in popularity that are more focused on compensating artists more fairly and working to create context in interesting ways. And yeah, I don't think that there's any doubt in my mind that the music world figures out ways to get past this streaming era.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So when you talk about what musicians have been screaming about for the streaming era or the streaming and screaming era, I know that you've talked about the incredible concentration of wealth with star acts and the fact that it just isn't a particularly good deal for anybody else. You've talked about Payola and Playlist and the fact that these are not neutral. That people are paying for prominence within these streams. You've talked about this idea of intermediating the relationship with the fans that I think of myself very much as a Welcome to Night Vale fan. I feel like I have a relationship with the creators of that and the cast behind it, but if suddenly my relationship is with Spotify and that's just a piece of content that sort of appears on it, are there other aspects of kind of the Spotify logic that musicians should be afraid of and that podcasters should be getting ready to see happen to them?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Liz Pelly\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's been this sort of general flattening out of the experience of being a music fan in the streaming era, but it also is just sort of the way that this streaming environment atomizes and disempowers the people who are making the work that powers the whole thing, right. So I think that's also an important part of the conversation as well. And thinking about how the idea of being an independent musician I think has been really exploited by the music industry in recent years who have tried to push this narrative of, \\\"Oh, you don't need a record label. You can just be this independent musician who uses the Spotify for Artists app and records your music and uploads it and sends it to our playlist curators and we have all these videos that you can watch where you can like learn how to hustle your way up to the top on the Spotify charts and all of this stuff.\\\" And I feel like it's a really major gig economy mindset, which in past articles I've written about is just absurd because of the extent to which the gig economy, musicians are the original gig workers.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Right, this isn't like Uber where the notion of becoming a taxi driver as a gig job might be new. It's been a good job for 99.9% of musicians for the last couple of thousands of years in one fashion or another. How do we fix this? So if Spotify is maybe sort of the worst example of what we might call streaming logic or digital music logic in which the really big thrive, the little players are disempowered, they have less of a relationship with their fans, but at the same time from the consumer point of view, it seems like a good deal. 80% of the music you might want to listen to might be available on these sites. And maybe you don't have to look too hard for that other 20% because there's a nice, satisfying 80% in there. What are the alternatives that we would build? If I give you money and power to build an alternative digital public infrastructure for music, what would it look like?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Liz Pelly\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So much of the thinking that has happened in the music industry on one hand has been like, \\\"How do we fix this?\\\" And I don't think that there's anything that any of these companies will ever be able to do to slap a bandaid on it and suddenly make it work because you're talking about publicly traded corporations that have no accountability to anyone except for their investors. And so over the past few years, there's been a lot of conversation within the music world and a lot of sort of reckoning artists aren't being compensated fairly through streaming services as this major conversation. And I want to acknowledge that I think that something really important has happened where a lot of music fans have started to pay for music more. Throughout the pandemic, Bandcamp has had these Bandcamp Fridays the first Friday of every month that have been these sort of holidays within the independent music world where people are paying millions of dollars to independent artists.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And that's great. And I feel like in terms of a short-term solution, this is really helpful, right? People who are true fans of music are thinking about how to directly support the artists that they care about. But in terms of something bigger picture, it's still this sort of situation where musicians are going on Twitter yelling, \\\"Please buy my album.\\\" And that still is something that depends on music having value if someone will individually pay for your record. And I think that there's also another way of looking at it where music is an important contribution to society. And we fund ways of distributing it. I listened to the first episode of your podcast and I wrote down this quote, \\\"There are lots of things that we ask society to pay for because they're public goods, not because they're turning an enormous profit.\\\" And to be able to put music into that conversation I think is really important and not something that has historically happened.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I love that idea because when I sort of look at the state of the art, I look at things like Band Camp and go, \\\"Well, this is great. It's a much better deal for musicians than many other options out there.\\\" I know Joe Holtz, who's one of the people who has built it and he's terrific and really sort of focused on the artists. And it's clearly a smart, thoughtful team. I've been watching some of the platforms that are sort of springing up to help artists through the pandemic. And I've been indulging my 1990s addiction to Robyn Hitchcock by catching his weekly shows on StageIt and sort of paying five or 10 bucks for an hour long house concert. And that feels like a step in the right direction, but these all require me to know who I'm looking for, who I want to listen to, who I want to support.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's so many other ways in which we encounter music. The art of the DJ, whether it's streaming in a club or whether it's streaming on a radio station, helping us explore and encounter different things the way in which music and performance sort of comes into our environment. It feels like even if we've done a decent job of creating less exploitative methods to let you support an individual artist, we haven't done particularly well with supporting music as a whole, as a cultural phenomenon, as a space. How would you, in the spirit of digital public infrastructures, I'll give you money and time. What do you want to build?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Liz Pelly\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, it's interesting because there has not historically been this public support for art. If you said to me just public money for music, I think the first thing that I would gravitates towards would be venues and independent venues. I know this is beyond the scope of digital infrastructure, but public funding for locally artists to run music venues is something that I think when bands go on tour in Europe, they encounter so much more regularly. And it's not something that has really ever happened to here. Venues, studio space, music, education, grants for artists to make records or to put on festivals and shows, things like that. This is the sort of stuff that I feel like we really need public funding for. But in addition to that, I also think, so I feel like there needs to be public funding for the stuff that keeps music communities alive, and then also, stuff that allows those artists to distribute their work online without anyone making a profit off of it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I think that that's really what's missing is the ability to share your music online with no one making a profit off of it because even some of these alternatives to the streaming status quo that are done with more of an independent spirit are still private companies that they're doing a good job, but I think that in order to fully have healthy public infrastructure for music, you also need some option that is making no profit at all and is solely working in service of music as a public good. And there are some interesting projects and alternatives and proposals that I've heard people talk about over the years ranging from just more funding for the arts to be put to use for these sorts of projects. I'm not sure how co-ops fit into the conversation of digital public infrastructure because-\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"They do.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Liz Pelly\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"... I don't know. They do. Okay. So there are a lot of interesting conversations around cooperatives that have been happening in the music world with the, I guess, major one being this thing called Resonate, which is a cooperatively run music streaming service that has existed since 2016, but without as much support as some of the other projects. I also, if this interests any listeners, there's also an interesting proposal that was made by this person named Henderson Cole who runs this music blog called The Alternative for something called the American Music Library, which would be a taxpayer funded library for music streaming sort of in the spirit of a public library.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Oh, that's beautiful.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Liz Pelly\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And I think that is a really interesting idea as well.

I'm really interested in the idea of a cooperatively run streaming service and a taxpayer funded streaming service that has I think in his proposal is that it would have no playlists and no curation at all. It would just be a repository for anyone to upload their music.

The worldwide web wasn't the first attempt at a global hypertext network. There's a network called Xanadu, which had built into it copyright, paying for everything, compensating creators, sort of making money as you go along. It never really came to pass in part because it was incredibly difficult to implement, but also in some ways free as in beer is a good way to sell a product. And when Sir Tim started building the world wide web, he was doing it in the physics community. That's a community with a very strong set of norms around free access to knowledge.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And in many ways, those norms sort of got picked up and disseminated. It's really interesting to see the different norms that thrive or don't thrive when we move into sort of new media spaces. I think one of the things that you said inside of your prescription for the future is that music has a lot of locality to it. It really is about communities. Instead of going out and having a particular scene, having a community that go to shows again and again. I know that I prefer to go to metal shows in Boston rather than going to them in New York because Boston knows how to mosh and New York doesn't. These are all things that would be really interesting if we can find ways to sort of ensure that they survive the pandemic, but also ensure that they survive digitization. And whether that includes creating new digital public spaces for music or whether it actually recognizes that the physical spaces where we encounter music have a digital and a social component as well.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Liz Pelly\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah.

I actually think that creativity around what it would mean to be a club or what it would mean to be a venue online would be an amazing space for people within a scene to be having that conversation right now. How could we jointly work together to figure out who gets to play and how we feature it and how we share it instead of where we go?

So that would be my hope for the space in some ways. And I guess maybe what I would say is let's not lose sight of this sort of pandemic moment where the systems broke down and we had to think about other ways to do it. This probably will not be the only pandemic of our lifetimes. And we need to think more broadly about what it means to create spaces for music in digital space.

And so I think with that proviso in mind though, what is wrong with the internet? And I think one thing that is wrong with the internet is that some of the biggest companies that have really shaped the modern experience of the web are built around a financial engine of online advertising, specifically a kind of advertising known as programmatic advertising. And this core financial engine has produced a lot of bad impacts on the design of the web, but I think also may actually lead to a great deal of instability as we think about how financially robust is this kind of structure that we've created over the last 20 years?

These guys sitting in smoke-filled offices saying offensive things to one another. And I do think that one of the things that's often missed is that the modern-day structure of advertising is very different from this.

Right. It's extremely data-driven and it's largely facilitated through algorithms that compete with one another to deliver an ad to someone. And so when you go search for a term, say carpenter, on Google, essentially there's a split section, a second auction that takes place to deliver an ad to you at that point in time, and there is basically a huge infrastructure that allows for these auctions to happen in between the time at which you click on a link and the time in which the website loads.

Right. And actually, the kind of allusion you're making there is a really good one, which is that there has been a lot of economic theory that has gone into designing these attention marketplaces. And a lot of it is, I think, very much tied to the sort of classic economic thinking which is, we create an extremely liquid market, people compete on price, and this should be a good way of clearing this inventory. It's an efficient way of doing that. Now, there's a couple of problems here, though. One of them is, that's unclear whether or not the ad at the other end actually works. And there's a lot in that statement, so let me unpack that a little bit.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There's the question of whether or not, if you see an ad, it is something that actually influences your behavior? There's not actually a whole lot of evidence to suggest that that might be the case. But also in many cases, an ad is delivered to someone who's not even real, so the prevalence of what's known as click fraud or ad fraud is huge in the economy. And so the ads might not even actually get to a real person, and in some cases, Google did this great study a number of years back where they said about 60% of ads that are delivered are never even seen because they appear in your browser, but below the fold. They're somewhat kind of weirdly placed so no one actually ever notices them. And so there's a lot of, I would say, interference between the purchase of an ad and its actual impact that people want, which is that someone would buy their service or buy their product.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But surely advertisers aren't idiots?

And one thing you learn looking at the history of market bubbles is that the fact that someone is spending a lot of money on something is not necessarily an indication that the market is actually functional.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Right. There was quite a robust market for very low quality distressed mortgages and for mortgage-backed securities that turned out at the end of the day to be largely worthless.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Tim Hwang\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Totally. Right. And I do think that there are a lot of perverse incentives in the ecosystem to keep this ball rolling. If you are an ad tech company, you're a Google or a Facebook or any of a large number of other companies that are in the ad tech space, you might very well want to really prove that this stuff, or show that this stuff, really works, and you have a lot of incentive to tout the benefits of this even if it doesn't. There's also extreme levels of opacity. We've built this incredibly large infrastructure for buying and selling attention online. The problem is, it's sometimes really difficult to understand why an ad is actually delivered to someone.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And then I think the final thing is actually, there's also empirical problems, which is, a lot of the academic literature on this topic of, do online ads work, land at the conclusion which is, they might work but the effect is so small that you have to run such a big experiment that in practical terms no one ever does. And so I think there's lots and lots of layers that prevent you both from knowing whether or not ads work and a lot of incentives for people to keep pushing the narrative that it in fact does work.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I absolutely take your point about the incentive, and I absolutely take the point that much of the work in this field is either sponsored by the ad tech companies or is only possible because of data coming from the ad tech companies. Certainly anecdotally, I have heard people on Facebook, for instance, talk about the fact that they flooded the market with Facebook ads and they got an uptick in sales. Is that not an existence proof that advertising works, even if it doesn't work necessarily as it says on the box? At least it does have some sort of an effect.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Tim Hwang\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, I think that's right. And to be clear, I think the claim of the book isn't necessarily that advertising categorically is ineffectual. Certainly we can point to examples in which it does. I think the question is, does that constitute... Is that the norm or is actually the outlier that we're pointing to? And we don't know because in many cases the ad tech companies have refused to give you the data that you would need to try to make those types of assessments.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Sure. And for instance, if we're at a situation where 60% of ads that are sold are never actually seen on a user's browser, and if we think about questions like click fraud, you might actually be dealing with a situation where an even smaller percentage are actually being delivered. Tim, talk about how click fraud works. Who is profiting when robots... I mean, I assume, distant relatives of your former legal colleagues are out there trying to make money by clicking ads on the web.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Tim Hwang\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, they're definitely in the same extended family, I think that's for sure. So, the way click fraud works is pretty straightforward and easy to understand. It's basically an advertiser goes to buy attention in this attention marketplace, and that attention marketplace says, \\\"Oh, here's someone on an iPhone just about to open this app.\\\" Or, \\\"Oh, here's someone on a laptop just about to look at this website.\\\" And basically the advertisers' algorithms are competing to buy the right to show things to those devices. Now what's interesting is in many cases, those devices may not actually be real, and the way the click fraud scam works is, you, the advertiser, purchases the ad, pays the person that's providing access to this eyeball, but it turns out that that person is just inventing all of the attention that they say they have. And so, rather than being delivered to a real person, it's either delivered to either a robot, or it's sometimes delivered to someone who doesn't care.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So you do have these incidents of these click farms where people actually just sit around and clicking on ads. They're not there to be interested in the products. They're mostly there to drive up the click-through rate so that they can pull the money from these advertisers. Ad fraud is a known problem in these programmatic ad markets and there has been work to try to deal with the problem. The perverse thing that I think is working against those initiatives though, is that in some ways this fake attention actually makes these marketplaces look more valuable than they actually are.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Sure.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Tim Hwang\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"These marketplaces-\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"They get a cut of it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Tim Hwang\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Totally. Right. And they take a percentage. And so, again, I think they have incentives to do just enough that their advertisers don't pull out of the system, but certainly not anything that would be structural to try to really resolve some of these issues. I think the other piece that I'll just mention really quickly is, I think that the bad guys, if you will, are really nimble. They're very clever at getting around these things, and in some cases what they are actually doing is they're spoofing like The New York Times. They're actually pretending to be known publications and the fact that that's a persistent problem, they haven't been able to stamp that out, I think just shows some of the problems with trying to resolve these issues.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Interesting.

So the Guardian actually I think filed a lawsuit against an ad tech company a few years back, in part because they discovered that people were selling ad inventory on the Guardian website that they didn't themselves even offer. It was like video ads on the Guardian which is totally made up inventory, and those scams can net millions and millions of dollars.

And I use that as an example in Subprime Attention Crisis to make the argument that this ecosystem is actually quite opaque, because it can be very difficult to know why your ad ends up next to this type of content. And actually efforts at controlling it, like the kind of efforts of the biggest brands in the world to try to prevent this from happening hasn't been able to really stem the problem. In fact you have activist groups like Sleeping Giants being able to surface lots of examples in which, effectively, there's some really terrible stuff on the internet being underwritten essentially through this ad system, even without the willingness of the advertiser. They sort of end up there in a number of cases.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I found myself learning a little bit more about Sleeping Giants when I found out that ads for MIT distance learning courses were airing on Breitbart.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Tim Hwang\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Oh, my God.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I had to find the academic department at MIT and who was doing the ad buys and help them understand that what they were buying was inventory that was running across many different sites, but that Breitbart was one of them. And of course they hadn't consciously made that choice. One of the things that I love about this is the term brand safety. I was involved with building some of the earliest web ad tech in 1996 and 1997. Our problem was, since we were hosting personal homepages and we weren't very good at controlling the contents of that, we would routinely have an advertiser like Ford Motor company find their ad on a page filled with gay pornography and they would cancel a contract with us.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"My boss gave me the job of figuring out how to stop that and my solution, of course, was the pop-up ad so that the ad didn't actually end up on the same page as the gay porn because we were so bad at stomping out-\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Tim Hwang\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Sure, yeah.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So there's a lot of bad things that you can accomplish in the name of brand safety.

That's how the 2008 crisis occurred. And so the claim here is like, \\\"Okay, so what is the trigger that causes a panic whereby advertisers say, 'Wait a minute, what are we spending millions and millions of dollars on?'\\\" And you're already starting to see these kinds of screens, like, well, head-scratcher moments.

But of course I'm not so concerned that Mark Zuckerberg has like a billion less dollars. That doesn't really matter to me. What I'm worrying more about is that there's a whole ecosystem of media creators and communities online and social media platforms, platforms that facilitate all of this communication in the public sphere that are dependent on this financial reactor, this engine, to keep going and to stay solvent.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Tim Hwang\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And so I do think that a sustained downturn in some of these programmatic ad markets really has a big human consequence.

I do think that there is a need maybe on really two places. The first one is that I do think that the power of the federal government becomes very useful here in compelling transparency from largely the ad tech duopoly, your Facebook and Googles of the world. And the thing I'm responding to there was, you may remember a few years back Facebook was really encouraging what was known as the pivot to video, that, our data suggests that everybody is watching Facebook video. There's more and more people that are going to be looking at this, and we're going to tweak our newsfeed to really promote video, so fire all your journalists and hire a bunch of video producers. And later it turned out, and in future litigation, there's been claims that basically that they inflated those numbers on the order of 60 to 80%.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Tim Hwang\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And the problem is that the advertisers don't have any leverage to get third-party auditors to go in and be like, \\\"Are the numbers that you're telling me about this ecosystem actually real or not?\\\" And I do think that there's room there for saying, \\\"Okay, what is the level of transparency we want out of these markets? And do we have to compel that disclosure?\\\" So I think that's the first one. A second one that I have a vision of, that the government might be involved in is, again, to take a very, very wonky analogy, but in the capital markets there's something that's known as the Security Act of 1933. And essentially what the Securities Act says is, if you're going to offer stocks on the marketplace, we require you to give us certain types of information about that product.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"If it turns out to be wrong later, you can be liable for it. And I do think that those types of incentives might be really powerful in a market like ads where there's just so much noise and there's basically no consequences for introducing bad data into the system. And so, again, the idea is not necessarily to try to figure out what ads are good or what ads will be effective, but in the very least for people to know what they're getting themselves into when they do buy an ad in these marketplaces. Now, I think the worry here is that the market, if you implemented these transparency measures, might be much smaller than it is right now, but I think it would also be a lot more stable in some ways if we didn't have all of the junk, like ad fraud, that's really inflating the scale of the market.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"You mentioned earlier on in this interview that you were hoping to piss off as many people as possible.

I do you think that part of the ethical problem with programmatic advertising is that it really is like corporate jet fuel. It's very difficult to find a similar model that just creates so massive of a return in such a short period of time. Of course, one of the reasons why it's been so popular is for that reason. Now the problem, though, is if you believe that a big chunk of that is fraud, what are we going to do? What's the Indiana Jones thing where we switch one thing for the other? The problem is we don't have a whole lot of other models that could guarantee that scale of growth that that's at that speed.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And so in some ways, probably implicitly what you're saying is, \\\"Okay, to change the business model of the web is also to shrink the size of the pie.\\\" And then it becomes really a big ethical question, which is, \\\"Okay, what level of shrinkage of that pie are we comfortable with?\\\" And are we willing to do that even in a world where we say, \\\"Okay, there's a number of well-meaning or well-deserving journalists that are funded by the secret system who will be out of work if you do this.\\\" And I think it's hard and this is one of the reasons, and this is my attempt to answer the question is... There's two things. One of them is, I really believe in what I call like a controlled demolition of this model. There's some people who are my friends who will say, \\\"Who cares? Let's just blow this whole thing up.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But I think the human cost is too great to really blow up the bubble in this way.

That's an indisputable benefit. And so I do think that really what I most hope for is an internet that's not just built on a monoculture, but instead has more of a diverse ecosystem of different business models.

And I think to some degree, we have another one of those now. We're in a moment where there's sort of technological utopianism and technological dystopianism. I think both of them are equally problematic because again, they're putting technology in many cases, the internet, at the center. We're so used to telling the story as though the internet is the primary actor when it truly is not. So I think we could really start there that's certainly one of the things that I think we could do is to begin to tell the story differently, that by focusing on the internet as the primary actor, as the thing that is either the solution or the thing we need to fix, might be something we could reconsider and actually try decentering that to tell the story differently.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It's a great way of starting a conversation to challenge the question behind it, and you're absolutely welcome to do it. Let me just unpack for sort of half a moment here, technological solutionism, this idea that if we keep building new innovative technologies, we will solve deeply seated human problems is something that has now become quite unfashionable. We've had critiques from every side sort of pointing out the limitations of a tech-centric view of the world. And you're certainly right, that this question of how do we fix the internet has a certain amount of utopianism sort of based in it. You want to talk more about power relationships.

It's one of these systems where, again, I think we can have a tendency to focus on the manifestations of artificial intelligence that we see every day. We might think about things like Siri and Alexa. We might think about autonomous vehicles. We might think about Google search. But what's really going on with AI, I think is a lot deeper, which is that it's really essentially a type of an extractive industry that is profoundly connected to mining and extraction from the resources to hidden forms of labor throughout the supply chain and of course, to forms of data extraction.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      So what you'll see the way that I sort of tend to think about artificial intelligence and power is by this almost exploded diagram. How do we think of the bigger picture of the systems of power in which AI is embedded? And also Ethan, I think we can do that with the internet. So, I think if there is a really positive contribution we can make to thinking about the internet and how we, quote unquote, fix it. Part of the first sort of step would be changing the lens of analysis in terms of what we think the internet is and where it is based. And to start to think about it more as a complex system in which we are really embedding a whole lot of other social institutions, ideas and capacities and affordances. That kind of broadening of the lens, I think is one of the most powerful steps that we can take to change the way we understand what the internet is and what can be done about it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Can I get you to talk a little bit about anatomy of an AI system and what were you trying to visualize in that work?

It's a really good example of precisely this sort of turn to thinking about broader infrastructures and power. So, that project started actually at a retreat that I was at Vladan Joler, the extraordinary sort of artist and information visualizer. And we were talking about voice enabled artificial intelligence, so things like Siri and Cortana, Alexa, and we thought about how would you actually think about what goes into making one of these systems? And so initially we had a small piece of paper and we were looking at the system like Amazon's Echo. So you have this little sort of cylinder device that sort of sits on your kitchen bench. What are the components inside it? Then how does it work? How does it relay data back into data centers? And then how do they analyze voices in order to respond to voice commands, like, \\\"Alexa, what's the weather today?\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      But in doing that, we realized that just telling that narrow slice of the story, really kind of occludes what's actually going on to make a system like that work. So we started to get bigger and bigger pieces of paper. Honestly, we started to get these giant bushes pieces of paper. We had 10 of them at one point, trying to go all the way back into what has to be mined to make one of these things work, to make data centers work? What energy requirements go into it? What about smelting? What about distribution? What about logistics? What about container shipping? And then all of the elements that go into the way in which these gigantic data systems have to work, all the way through, in fact, to the end of life of these systems where these devices get thrown out and they end up in e-waste tips in places like Pakistan and Ghana.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      So we did what you might consider, I guess, a full life cycle analysis of a single Amazon Echo unit, how they get created, the birth, the life, how they get used, and what happens to those data exchanges when we speak to these devices, all the way through to their death and sitting in these giant e-waste tips. And by doing that, it really transformed my thinking, Ethan, I have to say, to a relationship to technology, which first and foremost is to not be invested purely in the part of the system that you hold in your hand or that you engage with, or that is visually designed for you. But to look at these more sort of non-human and human together infrastructures that make them work. And by doing that, I think we can ask a very different question, which is what are the real costs of these systems? Often these systems feel as though they're free, and of course this deeply relates to internet discourse at the 1990s and early 2000s, the idea that so many things could be free and freedom in all of the senses of that word, but in fact with artificial intelligence, we have the same problem emerging that we tend to think of these systems as somehow being costless to us. But in fact, they're extremely costly and they're costly across these three vectors of the earth, of data and of labor.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But I'm really struck at your interest in sort of extraction and both the extractive industries necessary to produce these technologies, but also this notion of data as something extracted and labor as something extracted.

It's truly quite staggering. And that there are lots of easy figures that we can talk about. The fact that pre-COVID data centers were already issuing more carbon into the atmosphere than the airline industry in total. Of course, I imagine those figures are probably quite different now under COVID. It's probably considerably more than the airline industry, but we are looking at very real environmental costs from the sorts of large scale computation that artificial intelligence is.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      And then I started looking at the labor components and here there are many scholars who have done extraordinary studies. I'm thinking of Mary Gray and Sidd Suri's ghost work. I'm thinking of Lilly Irani's work. But really looking at the many types of labor along the pipeline. Now, those scholars have looked at things like crowd work or click work, the people who are really making artificial intelligence systems appear intelligent. So, this is often extremely underpaid work. It's sort of digital piecework really. And then I start from there and look further at all of the kinds of labor that are needed to make artificial intelligence work. And in many cases, in highly exploitive industries like mining.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      And then finally, I really look at data, which is as you know, to make artificial intelligence work, one of the things that's been really key has been creating large-scale training data sets. Now, where do they come from? Primarily, they come from the internet. They come from scraping all of those pictures that we've been putting up about our families, of our friends, of fun celebrations and holidays. They all go into these big training sets, which are used essentially to train artificial intelligence systems how to see the world, how to recognize faces, objects, et cetera. So the internet itself became a mind to create the way that artificial intelligence sees.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      So by doing all of this, what really became clear to me is that artificial intelligence is neither artificial nor intelligent.

It contains pictures of cats, of birds, of trees, of cars, of people, and it has been used essentially in so many cases to really drive computer vision as we know it today.

But there's also stranger categories that sort of move into more complex terrain, like DETA or micro economist. What does somebody look like if their bank account is in the red? But then the deeper we dug, the more we found really troubling categories, like really disturbing terms like kleptomaniac or alcoholic or bad person or loser. And there are people's faces that have been scraped off the internet, put in these categories and labeled in these ways. And of course, some very deeply racist and sexist terms that I won't be using on your podcast.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Just to explain for half a second, ImageNet is descended from a project called WordNet and WordNet is an attempt to create a hierarchical organization of all the words in the English language.

And in many cases, people don't necessarily stop and look really hard at all, why do we have this category, or why are we using this word, or where did it come from?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      So, one of the things that I've been spending a lot of time doing is tracing those genealogies, looking at where these terms, concepts and ideas came from, because in many cases, those are epistemological foundations, those ideas of knowledge building in artificial intelligence are quite shaky. They're built on these very shaky foundations. And when we really look at them, we find that their meanings are very unstable, but that instability in many cases is doing a sort of work. And what concerns me and why when we began our conversation, we were thinking about how artificial intelligence changes how we understand ourselves and understand other people is that those acts of classification, if you will, those moments of labeling and putting people into categories can actually be quite dangerous as well. And that's a much bigger problem than just AI and bias, which I know is something that you and I have talked a lot about and it gets a lot of column inches in the world. This is a really fundamental question around how these tools are actually classifying us, the things that we do and what has value in the world. So that is really the core issue.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      And I think, to get back to your question, Ethan, around the internet itself, the internet is one part of these sort of infrastructures that are sort of both input infrastructures that are taking lots of data from us. We give them lots of information and insights into ourselves, but also output structures. They're also representing us. And this is where I think AI has a big role to play and where we need a sort of a much bigger understanding of what is going on. And I think we get there by this type of forensic analysis of the systems themselves.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Is it the categories that are the problem, or is it the need to categorize that's the problem? So much of what we're using AI to do right now is to sort the world for us. Is it the sorting that's the problem, or is it the heritage of the categories that we've inherited and haven't examined that's the problem?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Kate Crawford\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I love this question. We've always used systems of classification to try and sort the world for us. I'm thinking of course of Linnaeus and the extraordinary sort of 18th century encyclopedias that tried to capture the entire world. I think that's a long established impulse, certainly since the Enlightenment, but you could go much further back. You could go back to Aristotle, in fact. So I think that sort of classificatory impulse has an extremely long history.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      I think what would really doing here though, is thinking about what are the politics of classification. And if we assume that somehow these technologies are doing neutral or objective work by simply classifying the world, then we're deluding ourselves. And in actual fact, we're walking blindly into a much bigger problem, which is that the world is infinitely complex. And by making these decisions of how we put it into bounding boxes, we're actually doing a very political act. And by not examining those politics, we actually create, I think, extreme problems for ourselves down the track. So, I think really what we're talking about here is what are the politics of classification? How can we actually interrogate those politics, and then ask different questions around what technology is supposed to do.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      Let me put it to you this way. One of the responses, particularly in critiques of the internet, and similarly in critiques of AI is if these things are problems, how do we make better AI, or how do we make a better internet? That's the natural sort of, well, the difficulty here, it takes us back to that extraordinary line from Audre Lorde of the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house. And this is particularly vivid when we look at artificial intelligence. At the moment, there really are only a handful of companies. You could quibble about which ones in particular, but really somewhere between four and five companies that own the backbone of artificial intelligence, the large scale planetary backbones on to which everything backs. I'm thinking here of things like Amazon's AWS, Google's Cloud, Microsoft's Azure. Alibaba has sort of similar backbone.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Enormous cloud computing resources that are really necessary to build these systems.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Kate Crawford\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yes. Precisely. We are talking about really a handful of these. Now, what have you do with artificial intelligence? You are backing onto these gigantic backbones. So you are, again, centralizing power in very few hands. I mean, it's hard to think of a more centralized industry. You really have to go back to the railroads, early days of the railroads to see so few hands really deciding the fate of large scale infrastructures. So that is the large scale question we have to ask.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      The second question we have to ask is if these systems by their nature reduce, classify and discriminate, now certainly no artificial intelligence machine learning in particular is a technology that is trained on making discriminations, is this different from that? How we understand this as being different from another thing. If these are the technologies that we're premised on, why do we think of those as somehow the only way to get to greater forms of justice?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      And this is why I think, again, de-centering technology as the only path is actually really important here, instead of asking, how do we make AI better, we should be asking, how do we make the world more just? How do we look at our systems of criminal justice, of housing, of education and healthcare, and try to address those core questions rather than centering, how does AI fix those problems for us? So this de-centering, I think, is really powerful because if we put the focus more on these questions of justice, on these questions of what kind of world do we want to live in, we approach these conversations differently. We start to say, let's look at the situations in which we're embedded, rather than the technologies as being the only way.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of the maybe most controversial AI systems that people have been looking at lately is an expert system, essentially, a set of rules that recommends whether or not someone should receive bail when they've been charged with a crime. And this system has been interrogated by Julia Angwin and her team over at The Markup. There seemed to be some very clear racial biases associated with it. My student, Chelsea Barrabas, has been really brilliantly about this larger problem of trying to outsource justice to algorithms. And in many ways, what I hear you essentially saying is these questions of justice can't be technological questions. They have to be much broader social questions. Point well-taken.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      Going back to the opening question that I'm now sort of regretting asking you, how should I open these conversations with people, Kate, because what I'm really trying to do is get over what to me feels like a tendency, particularly around social media, where it's very easy for us to sit there and say, Facebook's terrible. Twitter is terrible. We don't trust these companies, but it's often hard to progress that dialogue beyond the critique and the critique's enormously important, but part of what I want people to do is start envisioning systems that work very differently. And to get to that envisioning, in some ways we have to sort of get the critique out, let's acknowledge it and sort of go forward. What I'm inspired by in this conversation with you is sort of saying once we really think about the historical roots of AI, the assumptions that we've brought into it, once we do this work of challenging the objectivity, that sort of assertion of objectivity that comes from the algorithm decided this for us, then where do we go as far as our next?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Kate Crawford\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, I mean, it's interesting. I'm thinking of that line from the late, great Derrick Bell that Ruha Benjamind just recently reminded me of that to see the world as it is, we have to imagine it as it could be. So part of what I think is the most important question really is not how you would in an engineering sense, remake the internet. It's almost like how do we invest in the imaginative capacities of world-building and where might the internet be part of it and where might it not be part of it? How do we imagine this world differently? How do we imagine the things that we thought Twitter and Facebook were bringing to us and look with clear eyes around what these systems really do, which is very different to what they're purported to be doing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\u200B      The question is still a really relevant one, Ethan, but perhaps it's really asking it in not just how would we make the internet better, but what do we expect of the internet? How might we change those expectations and where might we find them in other places? So I think these are still really powerful questions to ask. And I think my provocation to you is really just, what do we put at the center? What is the central object of analysis here and how might we sort of think about the ways in which our imaginations could prompt different sorts of questions and different sorts of centers, if you will?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Kate, I love that shift, and it is a reminder for me that at the end of the day, I'm an engineer.

I would tell you these are political questions even more than they are social questions. They're ways of knowing, ways of understanding how societies should be understood, and in that sense, they're inherently democratic questions. And sometimes, engineering is not the most democratic way of being, as you know. It always prioritizes sort of engineering logics and engineers. And certainly, I think we've seen that the cost of that, certainly, we could think about the US election as just as just one place where the ways in which these networks that have been engineered to spike particularly particular forms of the most extreme content to drive debates into their most kind of polarized forms. These came from ad driven logics that were created by well-intentioned engineers who weren't necessarily thinking about political questions about democratic questions first.

They were built around the idea that the less friction is involved in sharing something or posting something or clicking on something the better.

And for much of the last decade, the biggest, most profitable AI project at Google has been YouTube recommendations. 70% of watch time on the platform comes from recommendations, and that's a company that is making billions of dollars a year.

It's based on what they can measure, which is watch time, which is clicks, which is shares.

When you go into a space in the physical world, the design of that space teaches you how to act in that space. If you go into a very austere and imposing, government building, the design of that space, the architecture, the columns, the layout, it tells you something about how you are supposed to behave in that space. And I think the same is true of online platforms, that when people go on 4chan or they go into a Facebook group for the Boogaloo movement, or they go onto a YouTube channel for a White nationalist, the design of that community, the architecture of the platform has a lot to do with how they will ultimately behave.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We talk a lot about norms and affordances when we look at different platforms.

We're based on surveillance capitalism, so we need you both to stay and share your eyeballs, but we also need information about you and either you need to put up information or you need to give us behavioral data so that we can follow you and sell the ads. But it has other aspects to it, and part of it is centralization and facelessness, everybody sees more or less the same Facebook, you can't change the affordances. The moderation is invisible, central, behind the scenes is holding on transparent.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So once you get your head around that logic, you can think about different logic's, right? Like, Reddit operates on a very different logic. You move into a space on Reddit and it's still ad supported, it's still tracking you, but the governance there has been handed to a team of moderators and they say, \\\"This is R/aw and if it's not a cute animal, you can't put it there. And by the way, we actually have defined cute very specifically, you can't put up your puppy who's recovering from surgery because that's making people feel bad, that's not actually cute, and if you don't like it, you can become a moderator and become part of it.\\\" So for me, I think that notion of taking the logic seriously makes a ton of sense. Facebook, in some ways, to me fails so much because it is one logic designed for everything two billion people might conceivably do on a social media platform. And it's also one in which they have no control over how its governed, or how the speech ends up working on it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Kevin Roose\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, and I think the other piece of this that you've identified is that human led governance is pretty effective, decentralized governance. Wikipedia is our most functional social network. And we don't think of it as a social network, but it is and its product is knowledge and is accuracy and that's what's valued in that community.

Moderators have a vested interest in keeping it civil and accurate and not allowing a ton of vandalism and so, there are norms in that community.

They are so invested in this idea that algorithms can do as good or better a job at things like assessing hate speech, at things like choosing relevant information for people, at defining authority for various news sources.

I would say you've got two things at work there. One is a norm, which is NPOV, neutral point of view and this idea that we're just going to batter stuff back and forth until we get something that we can all more or less agree with. And it may take the rough edges off of it, it may give us something that's smooth and comfortable and not necessarily as beautifully written, but it's something that we can get our heads around. There's also some incredible technical affordances and probably the easiest one to think about is the ability to roll back. The idea that with a click, you can basically say, \\\"Nope, vandalism, sorry, not worth it.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And that's an incredibly different logic, either than the chans where you say whatever you want and the stream of time brushes it away or within the Facebook logic, it's your words, you stand behind them and they're sacred and sacrosanct to a certain extent. Wikipedia has none of that sense of sacrosanct, if you're wrong, or if you're right and you can't defend it, it's gone and that's the space that you're agreeing to play within. But let me push you a little further. Can you imagine a vision of social media that isn't just less toxic than the patterns that you've identified, but is good for us? Is something that actually helps us as citizens or is the answer just that we've got to step away from this stuff and step offline or into other forms of storytelling?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Kevin Roose\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah.

So take, for example, Instagram. Instagram, you could rattle off a litany of harms, self image, things like that. But I think most people would agree that on the whole the information on Instagram has a higher integrity than the information on Facebook, why is that? Partly, I think it's because Instagram has chosen not to add features that might degrade the quality of the information on there and make it feel less intimate, less personal, so there's no native reshare on Instagram. You can't click a button and share something. There's also no links on Instagram, which removes a whole category of misbehavior that has plagued Facebook, which is this click bait economy that has grown up both in politics and outside of it and Facebook owns Instagram.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It's not a secret that you can do these things, that you can have a successful platform without those features, but they're so invested in the architecture of the big blue app that it's not clear to me that they're ever going to do that, but they have an example right there in their own company of a social network that is succeeding by not implementing certain features. Sure, it could have maybe added 5% daily active users by putting in a native reshare button, it could have maybe gotten more publishers more invested in the platform by adding links, these decisions have been weighed inside the company and they've chosen not to do them. Goldman Sachs always has this thing about how they're longterm greedy, and I think about that a lot in the context of tech firms, which I think are very short-term focused. I think they're very focused on next quarter's KPI's and next quarter's monthly actives.

We also have a direct channel to consumers for the distribution of all kinds of, let's say, products and goods that might be harmful, that might be unregulated, that have no oversight, right? There's so many ways in which the speed and scale of the current large social media monopolies work that I think we have to assess the incredible damage and reconsider whether this is a model or a part of the media system that we really want.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I want to talk a little bit about the damage and how we sort of assess and understand that. Early on, in your work that led up to Algorithms of Oppression, you did really memorable research about how totally innocuous searches on Google. Searching for black girls, for instance, had a very high chance of leading towards pornography, where searching for white girls did not. Google has subsequently changed things. You'll get black girls clothed when you search for black girls now, but for quite some time, when you were using Google to search for somebody like black girls, you were getting this highly sexualized content. What's the harm? Explain to us how that constitutes a harm, how that affects us as users of these tools and members of society.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Safiya Noble\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, we know from other forms of media pre-internet, for example, television and film, those industries, that when you circulate exploitive and stereotypical kinds of information or entertainment about communities, especially communities that are oppressed in our societies around the world, that it actually contributes to the dehumanization of those people. So, one of the reasons why I ... in that early study was looking at what happens when you look for girls of color. I looked at Asian girls, Latina girls, a lot of different kinds of girls and women, and found that over and over women and girls were sexually objectified in search.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, the challenge here is that the way people relate to search is that it is kind of like a public library.

There's not only an implication of objectivity, but when Google's own kind of moniker is organizing all the world's knowledge, then that actual organizing makes us think that there are some type of credibility or some veracity in the process of sorting through and indexing all of this content on the web. So, I think it's really important, as the public is engaging with these technologies, that they understand that they're actually advertising platforms. Of course, in the case of the highly sexualized content, it's really to do with the fact that the porn industry and other industries like it have more money than children and girls and even women.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, I think we have to ask ourselves this idea that those who can buy their way to the top can control certain narratives in our society. That really is what I was trying to point to more than anything in the book, is that we have a lot at stake when we leave our information knowledge landscape to these kinds of advertising companies that really are not invested in truth.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Right? So, in the case of search engines, the concern in many ways is we have something which is a proxy for truth, maybe a stand in for truth. It's an extremely imperfect stand in, but when you really unpack it, what it is is a marketplace. It is more advantageous for porn companies to be advertising on black girls or Asian girls than it is for an NGO, or for women's rights organization. Then, there's the strong possibility that we're going to have to be encountering that ad content. How does this play out in the social media spaces? Why does that relationship between advertising that the market associated with it, and the content that spreads on social media, why is that of such primary concern for you?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Safiya Noble\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, one of the things, Ethan, you and I both have been on the internet for a very long time. I'll tell you, we remember the pre-advertising days, and of course, the many models that came about to try to monetize people's activity and access to entertainment, and ideas, and all kinds of things on the web. So, first of all, we have this kind of publicly built infrastructure that was funded by taxpayers, in the kind of early internet days, then the move to commercialize the space. What it means is that the largest most moneyed actors in the world, and by that, I mean, organizations, businesses, governments, really are able to control the kinds of information that we come into contact with.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, that might be great on some levels. I think it's really helpful. I'd love to see, for example, the universities and the public libraries of the United States have a really big visible space for librarians and other kinds of information professionals, for example, to help curate and help us navigate through. In fact, you remember the early web, people thought of it as a virtual library. So, what we have though, instead, is this profit imperative, where return on shareholder investment is really the most important imperative in the social media and kind of big tech landscape.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What that means is, if people are harmed, and when you are talking about, let's say a little bit of propaganda, racist disinformation, hate speech, all kinds of things like that, only a little bit can grow to impact millions of people very quickly. That seems to be the collateral damage that big tech is willing to pay. They're willing to pay very minor fines when they're, for example, breaking the law or they're found in violation of civil rights law. The penalties are pretty low, they're kind of pocket change in relationship to the kind of return. Well, what that means then is the most vulnerable people in our society are the people who pay the highest cost and have the least amount of protection.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think that's something that it's just it's unsustainable. Of course, every day we just saw, in the last few hours, Jacob Blake being shot in the back, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, there's so many people we could name. Part of the, I think, way in which African-Americans in the United States, for example, are dehumanized through so much kind of vicious incorrect and stereotypical kinds of information that moves through these social media platforms really has a cost. It's not just the people that are harmed, but it's all of us who are witnesses to the harm and have the secondary trauma associated with the harm.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think we have to think about how we are going to re-imagine the kind of societies we want and what role these technologies play in bringing that forward.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think we should dig in a little bit to the situation with Jacob Blake, because it has some very direct situations where we might be able to trace harm back to social media. So, three days ago, Jacob Blake was shot in the back Kenosha, Wisconsin by Kenosha Police. He had been trying to break up a fight. He'd been entering his own vehicle and he was shot seven times in the back. As we're recording this, his family's reporting that he's alive, but paralyzed below the waist. There have now been nights of protests in Kenosha. Last night, things got very strange where not only did you have the police attacking protesters with tear gas, but there was a group of what appear to be Boogaloo boys who were armed people claiming to protect businesses in Kenosha area.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What appears to have happened is that one of those people, who may be a minor shot, a number of protestors and killed at least one of them. So, we're now at this situation where we're having peaceful protest as the result of incidents that are being documented, and the documentation is being spread on social media. We now have people coming to these protests to protect or to counter protest armed, and this is a movement that seems to come entirely out of social media. Boogaloo is a reference to this idea that we'll have Civil War, two electric boogaloo, and you have white ethnic nationalists as well as a lot of just anti-government forces who seem to be egging this on.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Is this the time that we just shutdown Facebook, and Reddit, and Twitter? What do we do at this point, Safiya? These tools that you correctly identify seem to be causing a great deal of harm.

There would be potentially a crackdown. Certainly, we know that for civil rights organizations in the history of the United States, especially the more recent history of the last 50 years, whether it's the American-Indian movement, the civil rights movement, Puerto Rico independence movement, the antiwar left in Vietnam protesting the Vietnam war. We know that if there were attempts and when there were attempts to organize people, for example, to stand up for civil and human rights, that the US Government, in fact, raided those organizations and facilitated the shutdown of movements.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, it's interesting to me to see right wing, far right extremist, fascist, white nationalist, neo-Nazis these are not all interchangeable terms, but these types of organizations are allowed to not only march up and down our streets with semi-automatic weapons and threaten and also kill peaceful protestors exercising their constitutional rights. But we also have companies that facilitate their ability to communicate, gather, and organize. Of course, I'm talking about Facebook, but also there are others. So, I find this incredibly disingenuous. I think that one of the reasons why these large social media companies have escaped accountability is because they have diluted the public officials into thinking that they are simply neutral tools.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That they are not responsible in any way for the content that moves through their systems. Of course, that's like saying that the cable television industry isn't responsible for the content that they broadcast because they're just the cables underground. That's just a ludicrous proposition. I think we're going to have to really revisit the way in which these companies are framed. It's not a fait accompli that they are here to stay either.

If it ends up carrying OANN rather than carrying Al-Jazeera America, those are very conscious content choices. I think a lot of these tools would like to argue that they're closer to a common carrier.

So, that seems to be, I think, the common carrier model. We've far eclipsed that let's say maybe by 25 years, at least. Now, we're into a situation where you can, one to many, one to millions of people, broadcast content.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Networks and other kinds of broadcasting industries have to think about their responsibility.

This is one of the things that I argue in the book, is that there's been so much focus, I think, on net neutrality in the FCC, again, in that kind of early model and early paradigm.

Modeling off of what the banking and finance industry did to really harm millions of Americans through their mortgage schemes and frauds. They're kind of betting against Americans and betting on their failures.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of the greatest, I think, things we want to remember about the mortgage crisis, which triggered Elizabeth Warren starting the Consumer Finance Protection Board and Rohit Chopra, who is our commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission also worked closely on that, is that we have the largest, for example, wipe out a black wealth in the history of the United States. Imagine all the gains, since emancipation, all of the gains in terms of wealth building effectively wiped out by Wall Street with the gamification, which quite frankly was facilitated by new predictive algorithmic modeling that was not previously possible.

So, I knew many people, for example, who have lost their homes, this is anecdotal, but I'll just say, okay, they reported Bank of America or they reported Wells Fargo. But in the end, it was the industry that got the bailout, not the homeowners themselves, they were never in a position to repurchase. Those same speculators went in and then snapped up all those properties for pennies on the dollar.

The United States that was, in many ways, literally inconceivable without the institution of slavery became a United States that is trying to figure itself out post that institution.

I really do imagine myself as more of a tech abolitionist probably than anything. When I say that, what I'm invoking for example is the institution of slavery and enslavement. Of course, one of the reasons why we pull back when we look at history is because we understand that there were arguments to be made, that the US economy could not function without a slave economy. It was only a handful of people who were abolitionists.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Who argued about the ethical and moral imperative that was at stake for the country, when it built its society on the notion that there had to be a permanent disposable underclass of people who had no rights and had no say over their lives.

People, my generation, I'm Generation X, our grandparents, many of our grandparents were sharecroppers. They were just one generation out of enslavement in terms of it's real practice and entrenchment.

People can't imagine that now, young people, but that tells you so much, and big tobacco is also really interesting because in many ways it's parallel to pouring millions and millions of dollars into research that was favorable to its own interests.

We know that the tobacco industry had to pay basically restoration back to the public. It had to put billions of dollars that were firewalled off from their ability to influence, that went into research, that helped the public understand the harms. Now, it doesn't mean that people can't smoke, but it does mean that people understand what they're doing now when they're smoking.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I think we need a similar kind of movement around big tech, where people at least have the opportunity to understand what they're doing.

All right. The reason why I say that is because I think we've thought of other kinds of media that we thought were here to stay, that really changed a lot with other opportunities or other possibilities that came along. So, one of the challenges here is that if social media continues on its same track, it's really going to devolve into such a cesspool. People are not going to want to be there. They're not going to want to participate. We already see the makers.

That they can't be on devices when they're with their children. So, they already know themselves about the addictive qualities of these technologies and about what it means to be classified, and documented, and cataloged into these systems from birth, and how harmful, and what the consequences long-term might be.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, I think we're going to see, for example, the first-generation soon of children who are adults who try to run for office, who try to become teachers, who try to become social workers, who try to do all kinds of things, and who will be damaged, in fact, or barred or precluded from doing some of those things because of this long history of their lives lived on social media. So, I want to offer that we might, through time, see that this did not serve us. That it actually undermined participation in public life, participation in education and employment opportunities. We're already seeing these kinds of things emerge and we're documenting these things.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, I say, it isn't a fait accompli that these things will be here forever, and maybe, maybe we don't need industrial skill technology. Maybe we will go like the ... I'd look metaphorically always to other kinds of movements, maybe like the response to the industrial level food industry and farming industry, we will have a slow food or a slow tech movement. Maybe we will find that an organic, slow, localized kind of connectivity that doesn't demand a 24 by seven type of connectivity and drive an addictive quality of life, might be more enjoyable. We have no idea what's possible and plausible, but I think it's incumbent upon us to try to imagine and try to dream about the kinds of lives and societies and communities we want to live in.

And so I kept looking at that model and saying, \\\"Well, maybe we should reopen that box and do something there. Can we make the technology work?\\\" And then I came across Elinor Ostrom's work on the economy of the commons, and I realized that what we'd created in social media ecosystems is a kind of public. It's a public that's governed in different ways. So in some parts of the world, it's very heavily governed by the state.

And given that Civic Signals is really deeply focused on this question of how to make it better, you seem like a great person to start with. So let me put you on the spot and ask you for a diagnosis.

So this is something that my co-founder of Civic Signals, Eli Pariser and I have been thinking a lot about. And we've really been focusing on your second part of your question, which is how to make it better. But let's start with why we need to make it better in the first place. And I think that in the popular world, there are so many things that are going wrong with social media right now. We have the in quotations, \\\"fake news\\\" or the spread of mis- and disinformation. We see people behaving poorly in these spaces and the proliferation of hate speech, et cetera.

And the way to gain profit is to make sure that you have lots of eyeballs and people returning to the social media platforms as frequently as you possibly can. And that they spend lots and lots of time there. And that's how the algorithms for many social media platforms are created.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"They figure out how is it that we keep them there as much time as we possibly can throughout the day. And I think that that's actually really a problem because it creates scenarios where the loudest voices are those that are highly partisan, they are saying terrible things. And that gets people coming back again and again. And there's a reward structure there for social media companies because they get advertising dollars as a consequences of that. So I think that this building for profit and doing so in a way that creates algorithms that reward bad behavior is a really problematic aspect of that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And if I'll add one more thing to this, although I could probably go on the rest of our time on aspects that need to be addressed, when the social media platforms have been called out for the problematic aspects of what they're doing. So, Facebook facing scrutiny or Twitter facing scrutiny for the proliferation of again, quotes \\\"fake news\\\" or the spread of mis- and disinformation, the response there in my mind has really been more of like a whack-a-mole strategy. Like, \\\"Okay, there's the bad thing today and I'm going to hit it that mole. And then, Oh, there's the bad thing tomorrow.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And yeah, they're developing teams and coming up with some infrastructure to address this, but that's really focused on responding to crisis rather than proactively figuring out, \\\"How do we move this forward?\\\" And as you said earlier, how do we think about this from a, what are some of the civics signals or ways in which we can signal good behavior?

And you're linking both of them really to two things, one is to a business model where these companies that are running Facebook, are running Twitter, are running YouTube, these are for-profit companies. At the end of the day, they make money through advertising. And so maximizing eyeballs, maximizing the people looking at the content is to their fiscal advantage. And then we're hypothesizing somewhat, but there's certainly a good arguments why this might be the case, that the algorithms that bring content to the front, that bring it to the top of the Facebook news feed, or that bring it into YouTube's recommender are favoring outrageous, eye-catching, highly emotive content because it's consistent with the business model for these platforms though, not necessarily consistent with what's good for us.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Talis Stroud\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Two things that I would quickly add is I think that what we see in terms of mis- and disinformation and people questioning what's real or not actually goes beyond online. And it can make people question those things then offline and think, \\\"What do we know in any context?\\\" Which I think is really tricky.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And then on the algorithms favoring outrage, we've done some research where we were looking at just for instance, on the New York Times, what of comments get the most recommendations. And it's those that talk about partisanship and use uncivil language. And if you have an algorithm that rewards things that get lots of interactions, like recommendations, those do percolate to the top. So I think absolutely fair to say that that's something that's happening there.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And then in terms of civic signals, what we're thinking about there is from platform behavior, from anything that happens on a platform, we send all sorts of signals. Right now, the way the architecture of the platforms is set up is that the signals that we're sending that are feeding algorithms are things such as liking a comment on Facebook or replying to something on Twitter. Those send signals. But they're signals that are really based on interactivity and engagement. And those are being used by algorithms to elevate content.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Well, we actually send a much broader array of signals when we interface with these platforms, the words that we write, the words contained in the articles that we share, the impression left by an image. All of these are also signals. And if we think about those as being signals, then there might be some content that's really civically rewarding, and that really helps to create a more public friendly space.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So we've been really thinking about these signals as we've been focused for so long on what's user-friendly, thinking very much at the individual level. And that's what it means to hit like on something. That's your individual behavior rewarding someone else's individual behavior. But what if instead of user-friendly we thought about this as public-friendly. So it's odd that we haven't really gone down this path and it's been so individually focused. But those sorts of signals are so much easier. It's so easy to add up the number of likes and use that to be an algorithm. But figuring out what are the indicators of civically beneficial behavior and do people get these civic rewards when they're taking part in social media? That's really what we wanted to uncover in the Civic Signals Project is thinking through, can we identify signals that platforms are actually having a beneficial influence at a societal or public level?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of the things that you seem to be implying is that there's civic content out there, and we just have to work to figure out how to surface it. Is it that easy? Are people really using these tools for civic purposes? And if they are, how do we find it? How do we find the content that would be healthy and helpful for us as a public?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Talis Stroud\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So I do think that there is civic content out there and we see it. There are fundraisers where people are raising money to deal with a crisis in another country, for example. That's a very civic act. And we see people increasingly doing that, at least on my Facebook feed, for example, for their birthdays. \\\"I'm raising money for such and such, a nonprofit organization.\\\" What a wonderful civic act.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Then you also see people trying to encourage others to sign petitions or to get involved in a variety of ways. Increasingly we see more and more hosts encouraging people to vote in the upcoming election. So I think that there is civic content out there and there's content that helps you humanize another person who you may never have really seen in that light. So I think it exists.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Do I think that that's all that has to happen here is just surfacing what's already existing? I don't think that's the case. I think that there's more to it than that. And I think essentially we have to think about the architecture and we keep using this metaphor of space because we find it so interesting. Eli really honed in on this. But it's the architecture that prioritizes your behavior in certain ways over others. And there has been research for instance, looking at if you design a space and you give all sorts of signals that you should be thoughtful there, like make it look like a library do all of that. People actually act very differently in that space than if you just say, \\\"Hey, leave a message,\\\" or something more casual. And so I think the architecture of these spaces also has to be considered, or is the architecture promoting people's actions in a civic way or not?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And as part of that, I think that that's a call to action essentially to platforms is thinking through not only algorithmically, how you might surface some of this content, but how could you create products and experiences within these platforms, given the opportunity to be citizens in these spaces when we still need these public spaces, particularly now in the middle of coronavirus where there's no space to have public conversations other than in digital life. So I think it's a \\\"yes, and\\\" sort of a situation of surfacing this content that does exist. And making it possible for people who want to have those experiences to find the architecture that supports them.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I like the spatial metaphor a great deal. And I was actually on with a team of designers from Facebook who were thinking about some of these civic challenges. And the explanation that I gave was a church and a pool hall and a library are all public spaces. But they have really, really different affordances. They have different things that you can technically do in them. Most churches don't serve beer, most libraries lack pool tables. But they also have norms. The speech that is acceptable in a pool hall might be different than the speech that's acceptable in church, or that's acceptable in a library.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of the things that is so incredibly challenging about a space like Facebook is that it is trying to build one room, one single type of room for every sort of frankly, public and private interaction. And it's incredibly hard to think about whether one room could ever meet those needs.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Let's get concrete on that for a second. What's the most surprising civic signal that someone has brought up? The most sort of unexpected or interesting one that's sort of come up in this conversation with a hundred or more experts?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Talis Stroud\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The one that has been the most vexing, I would say, and it's not perhaps surprising, but really thinking through is actually tricky. And so I would consider this to be surprising is how tricky it is, is there's a theory that dates back several decades called Agenda-Setting, which is the basic idea that if the media cover a particular issue, then that issue is seen as important by the public. And so there was this sense in talking to these variety of experts that that's kind of a responsibility in some ways in social media is to surface these important issues for the public to recognize.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But as soon as you get underneath that a little bit, it's actually much more complicated than that because you can have different subgroups that might have very, very different issue priorities. And how do you then think through what issues to prioritize if one subgroup has quite a different idea of an important issue compared to another?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"and where we've settled that in chatting with again, many different people who had perspectives on this is that one important civic signal or one important contribution that social media can make is by surfacing the interests of a variety of different major subgroups. So that if you have one particular subgroup and I'm using subgroups a bit loosely here, but thinking about this in terms of demographic or major political parties, is if an issue of the importance of one of those, not only surfacing it for those people, but surfacing it for those that might actually not be part of that subgroup.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And that I think was, it was surprising to me how a theory that's one that I've taught in my classes for a decade and a half now that I thought was almost a done deal in some ways, turned out to be one of the most conceptually challenging ones to think through because there are so many diverse interests. And I don't think that social media typically consider a responsibility to different divisions within society, which goes back to what you were saying earlier of creating one space that caters to everyone. Well, everyone doesn't always have the same shared interests. So that was one that I found surprising in its complexity.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I had a funny example of that recently. I've been driving my neighbor up to doctors appointments in Southern Vermont. And I live in Western Mass and weirdly enough, the politics even going in that sort of 30 mile drive can change quite a bit. And here we are surrounded by Black Lives Matter signs. And I drove 30 miles up the road to the nearest big city. And it turns out that there are signs in people's yards that say Black Rifles Matter, which is certainly a very different sentiment. And it's one that it's a useful reminder that it is shared by some of my neighbors.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And it's certainly true that social media, for me, has surfaced an enormous amount of Black Lives Matter content. It has been less good at surfacing the Black Rifles Matter in part because I'm sure on some level, the algorithms know that that is not a political point of view that I support. But it was this nice reminder that we have the ability to inscribe our opinions into physical space, but we can often end up in these really badly circumscribed social spaces, instead of remember that that view out there.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"You also mentioned that you got some feedback about the platforms doing a good job with these signals and affordances. What's a case where someone felt like the platforms were doing a good job?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Talis Stroud\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So in our focus groups, we ask people to tell us about experiences that they had had on social media. And some of the kind of surprising things from doing that, or people's incredible stories that they had about what they gained from being on social media. So it's the story of the grandmother that gets a chance to actually know her grandchild. It's the isolated individual who suddenly reconnects with their high school classmates. There was one story about a woman who didn't have the money I believe to buy a prom dress or something like that. And then everyone rally behind her to make sure she could get it. It's just these beautiful stories of people using social media to these incredible ends that have repercussions for individuals and for us socially. And I think that we tend to forget that a little bit.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So in our survey, we actually asked people to tell us whether they thought that social media made things better for them, worse for them, or didn't really have any effect. Most people think that these in general made their lives much, much better.

Do we like what they're doing to us individually? Do we like what they're doing to us as society?\\\" And in a funny way, the tech lash to a certain extent has been put on hold because at the moment, these are the only public spaces we have. So, we continue to have a tech executives going in front of Congress, but I don't really hear a lot of people talking about boycotting online space for the simple reason that right now, online space is space. And particularly as winter comes to some parts of the country, it's going to become more and more sort of important \", \"[inaudible 00:18:14]\", \".\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Let me throw out the question you \", \"[inaudible 00:18:18]\", \" involved with this project, all the experts you've talked to, all the survey work that you're doing, you're putting together a set of recommendations that could be incredibly helpful for a new social media platform. It could be a real roadmap for someone like YouTube or Facebook. How are you going to get these very, very powerful companies to take this advice? What is your feeling about how this work is going to be received and how it might be picked up?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Talis Stroud\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So there are different philosophies about how to go about doing this sort of work. And the tone that we've taken is we've actually chatted with folks within the social media platforms as we've gone throughout this process. So we've kept them in the loop. Like, \\\"These are some of the things that we're finding.\\\" And so I think we've been collaborators in a sense, quite external to what they're doing. And it's not something that we needed to call them about every week, but we have made an effort to make sure that they're fully aware of what we're doing so that they can adopt these sorts of strategies as they were thinking moving forward. So that's part of the strategy is making them into the process as we're going throughout it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"And then after that, our full intention is that we'll have briefings inside many of the major platforms to let them know like, \\\"Hey, here's what we found at this point. Here are the sorts of things that we're recommending.\\\" And then I do think that some of the information about how the platforms are performing, sharing that publicly, I think also has an effect in terms of how the platforms will respond to this.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yeah, it feels like in a certain way, for this to succeed, there needs to be a bit of a movement behind it. There needs to be a bit of an insistence that the platforms take our collective civic life seriously. And for me, it's one of the places where I see Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure and Civic Signals most allied, which is that we're sharing this common vision that these places, whether we like them or not, are going to be critically important for civics, even if the pandemic ends tomorrow. These are simply the spaces in which we are most likely to have these critically important conversations. And if they don't have the norms or affordances that help us have those conversations, they're going to remain an impoverished space.

We've been really active in terms of seeking out advice along the way, and bringing people with us slash having people bring us with them because we certainly aren't the first people to ever think about these ideas. There really is in my sense, a community forming around this. And I think that we hope that Civic Signals can start to be a place where people come together and kids start to have these conversations, both within platforms and creating new social media outlets and with others like you and the work that you're doing. That we can all come together to say, \\\"Look, now we're all part of this movement that we think this is a really, really important thing for democracy.\\\" To have this conversation and I think through the influence of social media outlets and to think through what the positive vision is that they should be working toward as opposed to whack-a-mole for the negatives.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ethan Zuckerman\"), \":\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So Talia, with that shared vision and the notion of a movement in mind, what are things that people can do to get involved with Civic Signals, to learn more about it?

I'm your host, Ethan Zuckerman.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Generally speaking, Reimagining the Internet is going to be an interview show. I'll be talking to an amazing array of people who are working on really creative projects that imagine the internet working radically different ways than it does today, hence the title of the show. But I want to make sure that I'm being honest with all of you. I'm not a neutral narrator. A lot of the work that I'm doing right now at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst is focused on a very particular view of how the internet could and should work in the future. So for the first episode of this podcast, I'm going to do the awkward work of interviewing myself and tell you a little bit about the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure, why we're starting a new center to do this and how those views might inform the conversations we're going to be having here with people who have quite different views, in many cases, with both what's wrong with the internet and what we might do to fix it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So who am I? My name is Ethan Zuckerman. I'm a professor at UMass Amherst. I teach in public policy, in communication and in information and computer science. But the answer is I'm a refugee from the very early days of the internet. In the mid-1990s, I helped start a company called Tripod.com, which was really one of the very first user-generated content companies on the web. It let people put up home pages for free. At the peak of its popularity, it had something like 18 million users per month, which was a whole lot back in the late 1990s when most people weren't using the internet.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The truth is user-generated content was both very new and very old ever. Since the 1970s, the main thing people who have been using the internet for is to share their own writing, whether it's emails, whether it's mailing lists, whether it was Usenet newsgroups, but making this accessible to a whole new generation of people in the 1990s really sparked the movement that we're seeing today with social media, where everybody is a content creator, and therefore everybody has the possibility of trying to influence the much larger social dialogue we have about what's going on in the world and how we view the world that we share.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So from that perspective of watching the internet and helping build it for the last 25 years, there's enormous amounts to be proud of. The internet has made it possible for people all over the world to raise their voices and share their ideas in ways that simply wouldn't have been possible before. I've had the great fortune to be involved with a project called Global Voices, which works to amplify voices of people in the developing world and share them all over the world. That's a project that's now been going on for more than a dozen years with thousands and thousands of posts from people in over a hundred different countries. But on the flip side, there's lots of reasons to be worried about the internet right now, its effect on us individually and the effects on us as a community, and particularly as a political community.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Nearly everyone listening to this will have heard about mis and disinformation, the possibility that the internet and social media are being used to manipulate us and to manipulate elections. The idea that the internet may be pushing us apart, polarizing us, making us less tolerant and more hateful. You may have also heard ideas that the internet is designed for addiction, designed to keep you clicking, that it may be bad for your self image, your self esteem or your mental health. I think all of those concerns are worth taking very seriously. Although, I'd point out that as a scholar in this space, many of those contentions have less support in research than they do in anecdote. But what I'm really interested in is seeing whether we can look at some of the assumptions behind the internet that we work with today and think about whether there's other ways of building a path out of our current problems and towards a better future.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So let's think, first of all, about the logic of the internet. When you use the tool like Facebook, you expect certain things from it. The first one you expect is that it's going to be free to use. Because it's free to use, you expect it to be supported in a particular way, targeted advertising. Advertisers are going to hope to steal a fraction of your attention. They're going to pull you away from what you're actually doing, which is trying to keep up with your friends or maybe stalk your ex or any number of other things people do on Facebook. Those advertisers are going to have a better chance of reaching you, perhaps, because they have data from the platform about what you do, what you like, and maybe intimate details about who you are. The author, Shoshana Zuboff, refers to this model as surveillance capitalism. We collect information about you and your preferences. We use it to target ads to you to sell, which in exchange make services free.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, this model has been really great for building and growing companies like Google and Facebook and Twitter and YouTube. It's been pretty great in the sense that it's given a lot of people a chance to connect to old friends, to publish things that they might not otherwise have been able to publish. But it has some real possible downsides. One observation that's been made is that the platforms have a really strong incentive to keep you watching, and therefore the content that they serve you may not just be an unbiased view of what your friends are saying about the world. There's a good chance that Facebook might feed you information that is sensational or highly emotional or one way or another intended to capture your emotions and keep you watching and viewing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The theory behind this is that if you're seeing more emotional, high emotional valence content, there's a good chance that it might try to sway you politically. Or maybe it might be the sort of content that tries to misinform you about the risks of something like COVID-19. There's a lot of research going on right now trying to figure out how true this is, how much are we actually being manipulated by our feeds. But because the logic of surveillance capitalism works in a particular way, there's ample reason to be concerned. But here's the interesting trick, surveillance capitalism isn't the only possible model for the internet. We know that to be true because there's some really exciting sites out there that work on a different logic.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Consider Wikipedia. Like Facebook, Wikipedia is made by average users. People are allowed to go on and write what they like. Except on Wikipedia, they can't write exactly what they like. They actually have to write within a very specific model. They're writing encyclopedia entries and they can be overwritten and corrected by other users until an article reaches what Wikipedia calls neutral point of view. While it sounds crazy, like having a bunch of monkeys struggling with a typewriter until they write an encyclopedia, it actually has worked remarkably well. Wikipedia is one of the top 10 sites on the internet in virtually every country where it's used and it doesn't accept advertising. It's also not supported by subscription. Instead, it's supported by donation, mostly small donations from its users. It's driven not so much by profit, but by a mission, the mission of making knowledge free and accessible to everyone around the world.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, Wikipedia is unusual. It's really one of the very few sites that's been able to work this way, but it offers this intriguing idea that there could be different logics that inform the internet. So I want to suggest a different logic that I've spent a while thinking about, which is the logic of public broadcasting. Most major democracies have a public broadcaster. This is different from having government media where you're hearing propaganda from the government. In countries like Germany and in Britain, the public broadcaster is usually the most respected source of broadcast news. It is supported by taxpayer dollars, but it's governed by an independent board of governors. Because it's under such careful scrutiny, it tends to be extremely careful about not taking it over a political stance in one direction or another.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It too has a mission. Its goal is to provide reliable information that people need as citizens in a democracy and to showcase voices that might not otherwise be heard, particularly from minority populations or parts of the country that might not otherwise be heard from. So what happens if we take a logic like this, a medium that works based on taxpayer support, that has explicit civic goals behind it and apply it to the space of social media? Well, you might get something a little bit like what we're trying to build with Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure. We're talking about public spaces online, spaces where people get together and talk about the future, whether it's politics, whether about their local communities. These are civic spaces, sort of broader than political.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"You might not be talking about who's going to win the 2020 US election, but you might be talking about how to revitalize the downtown of your hometown. Right now, most of these conversations take place on platforms that are owned by Facebook, Twitter, Google that work under this logic of surveillance capitalism. They are digital public spaces on top of private infrastructures. We're investigating this idea that maybe we can build these digital public spaces on top of public infrastructures. These would be new spaces. They'd be supported by taxpayer dollars, at least at first. Instead of having the logic of surveillance capitalism and maximizing profit, these are spaces that could work on a civic logic. So you might imagine there could be a social network designed specifically for the people in your town to talk about local issues and it might not be open to anyone outside of your town. These networks don't have to be huge. In fact, maybe they benefit from being small.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"You might also imagine a network that you could voluntarily join and have civil arguments with people who have a different political point of view from you. These spaces probably can't be free-for-alls. You'd probably design them to be very heavily moderated. But you might actually have them moderated by the community that uses them. This is a model that we see on websites like Reddit, where people are involved with actually governing the spaces that they work within. Why don't these spaces exist right now? Well, one answer is that they're not very profitable. You don't necessarily make a ton of money hosting a forum where people come together and debate whether we should have a dog park. But that doesn't mean that it's not necessary. In fact, there's lots of things that we ask our societies to pay for as public goods, because we need them not necessarily because they turn an enormous profit.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The other reason that these spaces don't exist is that existing social media networks work pretty hard to make sure that they have a monopoly of eyeballs. Facebook is pretty notorious when other social networks are getting traction for buying them up and incorporating them sometimes as they did with Instagram, or just making sure that they don't grow much further. By stepping outside of the venture capital world and the world in which your investors will always sell a network to a big company like Google or Facebook, and instead accepting this idea that we might invest as a society in building these sorts of spaces, we take ourselves out of that equation.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But we've still got other big problems. Lots and lots of people have tried to reinvent social media. The problem with doing so is that you can start a great social network and there's some exciting new ones out there, but they have a very, very hard time getting up to a large enough size where they have network effects. So if you end up joining Diaspora or Mastodon, you may find that you don't spend as much time on it as you would like to because your friends aren't on it as well. So the work that we're doing at Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure has a lot to do with interoperability. We want to make sure that people can use these new sorts of social networks that we're creating, but that they're still able to use the networks that they already have friends and a presence on like Twitter and Facebook.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In fact, we're going after an idea called adversarial interoperability. We want to be interoperable with these networks, whether they like it or not and that has all sorts of interesting technical and legal implications to it that I'm sure we'll be discussing as we get further within this podcast. Social media isn't the only goal behind the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure. We're interested in building all sorts of digital tools that move away from a pure advertising surveillance and profit logic and into a logic that's more focused on civics and on healthy online communities. So you'll hear me talk more about this over the course of these interviews. Some of my ideas are sure to creep in.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"If you feel like learning more about this, we have a bunch of papers up at publicinfrastructure.org that flesh out the digital public infrastructure idea. But I want to assure you that if you're listening to this and thinking, \\\"This guy's crazy, this will never work,\\\" that doesn't mean you should stop listening to this podcast because the truth is we're going to invite a lot of different people with many different visions for what the internet can and should be to come in and have conversations. Some of the people we're hoping to bring in include some people who are really early pioneers on the internet, who've built some of the things that have made the web that we love and sometimes love to hate as well as some new entrepreneurs, some incredible scholars, some hackers who are really deep down in the trenches of building these new systems.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Our goal is really to give you an overview of a world that if you don't know about it might look really static, but actually is going through an amazing amount of activity and creativity right now. So I hope you'll come back and join us on this podcast, Reimagining the Internet. We're going to be releasing interviews on a semi-regular basis, one every two weeks or so, as we lead up to the launch of this new center at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
