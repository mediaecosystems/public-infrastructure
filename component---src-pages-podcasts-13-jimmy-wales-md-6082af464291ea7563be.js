Jimmy is best known for Wikipedia and the Wikimedia foundation, an extraordinary set of projects celebrating their 20th anniversary. He's worked on a number of projects since then, including Wikia, including Wiki Tribune, and now WT Social, all of which in many ways, I think, we can think of as ways to address underlying challenges of what's going on on the internet.

Obviously, the result of Wikipedia, i.e. the encyclopedia itself, is pretty remarkable. We're one of the most popular websites in the world and famous all over the world with millions and millions of entries of generally okay quality, and some of them quite excellent, and some of them need some work. That's the nature of Wikipedia. I'm also very proud of the community. I'm proud of my role in that community in the sense of, I didn't write this encyclopedia, but I did play a part. I'm happy about that community and the values that we put in place in the early days of thoughtfulness, kindness, quality. One of the oldest rules of Wikipedia, which I remember writing, was no personal attacks, which is quite rare on the internet, as we know. That's kind of amazing."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"Then there's also the business model, so to speak, in the sense not just that we're a nonprofit organization, because I think that that's a piece of it, but also that we don't get money by selling data, we don't get money by having ads. We just ask people to support us, and that's it, and it works. That's kind of an amazing thing. I'm sure we'll get into this in great detail, but it has a lot of implications that people might not have thought about, and in fact, indeed from the early days of Wikipedia, I didn't think of all of the implications of what an advertising only business model meant. I just knew I didn't want that."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,Object(n.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"Yeah, I think almost no one thought, about at that point, what we were buying into when we were buying into the advertising business model. A lot of what I want to talk with you today is about WT social, but I want to run something past you because I actually think it's one of the more extraordinary things that Wikipedia and Wikimedia more broadly have accomplished. If we were having this conversation 10 years ago, we would be talking about accuracy. We would be talking about, is it dangerous that anyone can write whatever they want on Wikipedia? We're now at a point where YouTube uses Wikipedia to try to provide neutral factual content to counter disinformation that's spreading on their service. In other words, in a world where everything appears to be in dispute, where you have fights over reality within politics, the Wikipedia model has somehow emerged as one of the few ways to make things genuinely knowable. Are you at all surprised by that? You were right in the middle of a ton of those debates a decade ago. Am I over-hyping it, or does that line up with how you think about it?"),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,Object(n.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Jimmy Wales:")),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"No, it's certainly the case. What I've taken to saying is that we were never as bad as they said we were, and we are not as good as they think we are. There was kind of a hype cycle around Wikipedia. I always used to remind fellow Wikipedians when we get some really bad press about some error in Wikipedia to say, look, I remembered a few years prior when eBay was first a thing ... eBay, of course, is very different, but also faced this question of, I'm going to send my money and somebody is going to actually send me the Pez dispenser? Is that insane? I said, look, there was a brief period of time when it was very fashionable, mainly because it was easy and lazy to do as a journalist, to write a story that said, oh my God, someone's selling their baby on eBay. Someone's selling their gun on eBay. Look at this horrible thing that's happening on eBay."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"Then after a little while people realize, you know what? You can go on eBay and you can list your baby for sale, somebody is going to flag it and they're going to take it down. It's not that exciting. It's really not that interesting, but it seemed interesting for a little while. Similarly at Wikipedia, yeah, you can go and click edit and change an entry to be something ridiculous, and then somebody is going to fix it in five minutes, and that's kind of okay. It's not great, but it's just part of the process, and in fact, that process yields something quite good over a long period of time. There was that blip in time when it was just like ... Well, gosh, I remember when Anna Nicole Smith died, she was a famous sort of actress, model? I'm not exactly sure what she was, but ...

I said, it's a fundamental flaw with tabloid newspapers that Anna Nicole Smith dies and I get eight phone calls about it. Honestly, it's not that interesting. None of this is. By the way, there's actual news somewhere in the world, I'm sure. That's changed. But again, we try to be humble about where we are today. Yes, of course. People do trust us more than they used to, but yes, we know there are errors and Wikipedia, there are problems, there's things that we could improve. It is better than it used to be, because, well, that's the whole point. We're always trying to make it better.

As people keep adding to it, it's going to get better and better over time, and at a certain point, when we're at a point of near stability, we then get into a sort of vandalism prevention mode. I think one of the things I've marveled about is that Wikipedia seems really, really good at some things, and then has had a harder time with other things. For instance, WikiTribune, which was a focus of yours for a while, and tell me if I'm not being fair, was taking something of a Wikipedian approach to news. It always felt to me in some ways like Wiki Tribune's toughest competition was Wikipedia, which actually does news surprisingly well. Has it been hard to bring this process that seems to work so well in the encyclopedia into other spheres?"),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"Yeah. It's really interesting, because the encyclopedia as a genre is unique in certain ways. One, it's supposed to be neutral. That's really important, because it does allow people of different ideas to find a way to work together harmoniously. Maybe you and I are going to edit a piece about some politician and we disagree. I think they're good and you don't like them so much.

That was one of the earliest problems. Of course, the Wikimedia foundation has Wiki News, which was an early attempt to news. I remember a case, and you can date this from when it happened. When George W. Bush was reelected, Colin Powell resigned soon after, and all media were reporting it an expected resignation, that he was ready to retire. It was not really a big scandalous story. Wiki News was reporting it as, everybody's jumping ship on the Bush administration now, in a slightly different way. I thought, I think that's slanted and I think it's a little bit biased, and I should fix it. But of course, it's a news story and I didn't have time that day, and by three days later, it didn't matter anymore. Whereas if you go to the article on Colin Powell, which is going to be there for, if I have anything to do with it, a hundred years, it's slowly refined ..."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,Object(n.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"You can fix it.

Those are some of the things that make it easier to do an encyclopedia. Then for news, for me with WikiTribune, and actually WT social is the kind of continuation and a modification of it, is really to ask ourselves the question, we've got a lot of great people in the world, and you wouldn't know it from looking at Twitter or something like that. You can find great people anywhere, but a lot of the systems out there seem to be designed to amplify the loudest and most inflammatory voices. Where are the quiet, thoughtful people who are wanting to engage with journalism and news in new ways, and what can they actually contribute to the process? Sometimes I think that journalists don't have the right idea about this, because they don't really know Wikipedians."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"Many good journalists think that they're the only ones who can actually be neutral and interpret the world in that kind of journalistic way. I know that's wrong. But they do have certain advantages that most people don't have, which is the institution behind them that gives them access. If you're the new treasury secretary and you get a call that says the New York Times would like to speak to you, you take that call. If you get that some rando from some website wants to talk to you, you just don't have time. That's just practical. Right? Sometimes it's unfortunate because then we know there's a lot of access journalism and things that come bad with that. But the truth is, there's not much you can do about that. Ordinary people are never going to have access. That's a tricky problem, but I still think there's there's room for new ways of thinking and new systems. This is where we are at WT Social, to say, how can people engage with news, engage with journalism in a way that isn't just yelling at each other, and is constructive and positive?

And talk about kind of some of the more theoretical grounding. I've become convinced that there's something deeply wrong with the advertising only business model for social media, and it's not necessarily the problems I would have predicted. As an example, as a piece of it, one of the things that's problematic today is programmatic advertising. This is the ads that follow you around on the web because they've used cookies and they figured out who you are and they give you ads that are more relevant. Let's just say at the outset, I think it's really great in certain ways. One of the ways that's really great is, wherever I go on the web, I get ads that are actually meaningful to me. I always joke it's, I get ads for boats all the time because I like boats and I read boating magazines. It's boats I can't afford, so it's like boat porn, but I click anyway."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"That's fine. That's actually very good. It means that the publishers are making more money from those ads than they would if they were giving me completely random ads, which is what I used to see. There's certain things that are good about that."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"However, there is something very bad about it, which is if I go to a long form piece in the Guardian, we've got some fantastic reporting that the Guardian did about Ed Snowden. I go to read a long form piece there, I see the exact same ad as if I go on Reddit, which is a very cheap to produce giant message board, which means every piece of content is competing with every other piece of content, which makes doing expensive journalism really hard. So that model isn't working."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"But then there's another layer as well, which is that it means that for the social media companies, their incentives are really all about engagement, time on site, how to keep me there, keep me clicking as long as possible. You can really talk about some very simple ideas, and I'm definitely not a neuroscientist, but I don't think this is completely absurd to say: there's the monkey brain or the reptilian brain, and then there's my Aristotelian brain. My Aristotelian brain says, oh great, I've got an hour. I'm going to sit down on the internet. I'm going to do something and I'm going to become a better person ever so slightly in the next hour. Then there's the monkey brain that goes, ooh, what's that? I've got to click on that. Pretty soon the hour has been wasted, and that's a problem."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"That's really driven by the business model, and I think it's very hard. When we talk about things like Facebook's efforts to rid the platform of misinformation and so forth, which I do think there are good people there who are sincerely trying to do that. I think they will find it very hard, because fundamentally it's not clear to me that their business model wants them to do that. That, in fact, the things that people ... There's the famous, I think it's XKCD comic: come to sleep, dear. I can't, someone is wrong on the internet. Somebody posting something completely ... You and I have been on the internet for a little while, and don't feed the trolls. I remember the Usenet days.

Actually, I think about this in the context of Google, as an example. Google, I think, has many different businesses even within just the website, nevermind Alphabet and all their other projects. But YouTube suffers from this difficulty because they struggle to make sure that their algorithm doesn't just lead people to Qanon videos, because it turns out, like rubber necking at a traffic wreck, people do that. Whereas search doesn't really have this problem, because search isn't about viral, it isn't about hang time. People go there ... Also, it's very profitable because you searched for candid camera and you get an ad. that totally makes sense, and it doesn't involve the same kind of incentives that YouTube gives them that problem."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"With WT social, one of the concepts is to say, well, look, we're not going to have ads, and we're not going to have a paywall. I joke, a series of bad business decisions, but that's how I've built my career so far. But the main reason for that is to say, now that totally resets my thinking. A lot of the metrics that you would normally really care about, you still have to think about. Let me be a little nuanced here. It's not like ... When people come to the site, my incentive is I have to give you an experience that, over a long period of time, you enjoy enough that when we say, would you chip in? You go, you know what? This something to me."),Object(n.mdx)("p",null,"Because that's what people do at Wikipedia. They say, oh yeah, you don't have to pay. But people are like, you know what? This is meaningful. I'm going to chip in, because I think this is worth it. It's a tough business model. But the incentive is then not to make you click every day, it's to make sure that when you come, you leave going, you know what? That was good experience. Now, I'm not sure I've achieved that yet. Part of the issue is, once you've said that, you also can't just completely ignore some basic metrics. If people are like, wow, Jimmy, this is fantastic. I heard you on Ethan's podcast and I'm going to go and sign up because this is the vision of the world I like, and then you come to the site and you're like, okay, but this is boring.

I have a project that I've been working on over at the Knight First Amendment Institute over at Columbia, trying to sort of map different types of social networks. It's funny, we always talk Facebook and Twitter. They're the two that we come back to all the time. The truth is, there's a huge wealth of things that we call social networks that are actually quite different. The third most popular category we found are question and answer networks. Things like Quora, all these different programming boards where people will put up questions and give answers, and it's a very different form of conversation, actually can be a very rich type of conversation.

There's media, including the Zoom medium that we're using here, and there's all sorts of interesting, different ways to intersect.
