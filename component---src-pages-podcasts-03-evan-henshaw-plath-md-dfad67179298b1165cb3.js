And a bunch of us who had been working on it, kept thinking what if that other path had been taken? And so I kept looking at that model and saying, \"Well, maybe we should reopen that box and do something there. Can we make the technology work?\" And then I came across Elinor Ostrom's work on the economy of the commons, and I realized that what we'd created in social media ecosystems is a kind of public. It's a public that's governed in different ways. So in some parts of the world, it's very heavily governed by the state.

Really exciting to see it taking off. So many of the same problems and questions that we're facing over at our project, we start from aggregation as our first step, precisely for the reason that you're talking about. One of the things I really have to get my head around is how we aggregate into Planetary, given that you're using a very different approach to URLs and the ability to share posts. But that's a technical conversation we have to have at some point. In the meantime, though, this notion of true decentralization, identity that resides on the phone or on the device and this vision of many different spaces with many different rule sets is so aligned with what we're trying to do. I hope we're going to have a chance to keep talking about this as we both go forward with these projects."))}r.isMDXComponent=!0},zLVn:function(e,t,a){"use strict";function n(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,n,o={},i=Object.keys(e);for(n=0;n<i.length;n++)a=i[n],t.indexOf(a)>=0||(o[a]=e[a]);return o}a.d(t,"a",(function(){return n}))}}]);
