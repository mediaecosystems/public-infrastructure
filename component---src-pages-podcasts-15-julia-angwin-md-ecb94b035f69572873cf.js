Essentially they're in a big newsroom like that, might be 10 data reporters for hundreds of other reporters to use as their partners. And so it becomes a little bit of a DMV situation, you have to take a number, wait in line. And I was always sort of in trouble a little bit for overusing the data resources.

One thing about The Markup is the data reporters don't report to a different data editor. They are part of the investigative team. They come up with investigative story ideas.

And many of those links inside of the boxes, in the info boxes are actually just to Google itself. And so we wanted to measure this.

He borrowed from biology and the idea of staining a cell to see which parts of it were different than others. We actually scraped all these search result pages and then stained them to identify which parts were the Google products in which parts were links to the external web.

It sounds like you're having some of the same thing in sort of analyzing technical systems and particularly the sort of technical systems that we interact with every day, whether it's search engines, whether it's social media. A lot of our conversation on this podcast is about sort of diagnosing and then sort of envisioning fixes for social media as it currently exists.

We don't propose policy solutions, but I think when you get really close to a topic and really precise about the diagnosis, then the solution actually can more naturally reveal itself. We wrote a story recently about Facebook and how they had said they were stopping recommending political groups. And then our data showed that they didn't stop. And we have a hypothesis we haven't been able to prove, but it looks in the data like they just stopped recommending groups that self-identified themselves with a political tag.

It's a really hard question and one that I've thought about a lot. And I ultimately came to the realization that we were going to have to do something pretty crazy in order to answer this question. And what that crazy thing was is a project called Citizen Browser. Basically we have built a tool, kind of a custom web browser that we distribute to panelists who we pay to install it on their computer. And they log into Facebook through this app and then they never touch it again. But it allows us to once or twice a day, take a scan of what's at the top in their newsfeed. We then put it through this crazy pipeline where we redact every bit of personally identifiable information about them and their friends and any comments and messages, anything personal, photos.

And the only way to do that because everyone's feed is individual, is to build this panel. And so we've taken this panel approach, which has been extremely expensive and we've had eight developers, 10 months, it's an enormous effort. It costs half a million dollars a year in a run. I'm currently raising money for that so if anyone's listening, please send us a big check. And so, but I do think it's the only way, there may be other ways, but it's one of the best ways I can think of to try to monitor this black box."),Object(i.mdx)("p",null,Object(i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),Object(i.mdx)("p",null,"One of the analogies that I've sort of thought of for Citizen Browser is almost this notion of people creating their own network of air sensors.

It looked at their feed and extracted ads and sent them to us so we could see what political ads were being shown. But the ProPublica readership was very liberal and so we basically only got liberal ads. And so it was a really limited and useful, but limited window into Facebook. And so that's why when I just wanted to take another stab at this question, I realized we're going to have to pay people so we could get a representative sample. We don't have, by the way, as many Trump voters as we do Biden voters. And that's how we're making the distinction on political affiliation."),Object(i.mdx)("p",null,"You could do it lots of ways, but that seemed like the most obvious way to do it in this year.

How much of it is Facebook's fault? How much is the user?

And it would say, not only do you want to target these ethnicities, but do you want to block these ethnicities from seeing the ad? I thought, well, huh, could you actually do housing discrimination this way? Because it's against a lot to advertise your housing to just one race or deny some people of some race to see the ad. And we bought an ad that was discriminated. It said, \"Don't show this housing ad to black people.\" And it went through and it approved.

They're like, \"No, no, no, we have to build this massive algorithm.\" Then what happened is that not I but then the fair housing groups continued to buy ads after that. Were able to get them through, HUD sued them. Finally, it wasn't until last summer that they were like, you know what?

The fact that you really can't get hired without some weird hiring algorithm being run on your resume, which automatically disqualifies all sorts of people, as Amazon revealed. They were just rejecting all women, their algorithm was tuned wrong. That's the kind of thing, the everyday harms that are actually so pervasive and so understudied is I think what we are really passionate about at The Markup and we try to spend as much time as possible on, but those are really hard stories to get. Building those data sets is even harder than what we're doing with Citizen Browser, which is saying something because private companies don't have to share their hiring algorithms."),Object(i.mdx)("p",null,Object(i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Julia Angwin:")),Object(i.mdx)("p",null,"Do we buy that software and test it ourselves?

And the truth is that a lot of people are using it to cover their ass. If they want to make a decision that's not popular, like keeping someone in jail longer or not hiring someone, it's so much easier to say the algorithm did it. And so this problem won't go away, even if there's an algorithmic auditing agency. And I think our skills will always be helpful in trying to show how these algorithms are.

It's not the YouTube recommendation algorithm, it's algorithms about who gets housing in Los Angeles and what's sort of built into that. I also think the example that you just gave with Amazon is this great reminder that it's possible to be dumb as well as evil or even dumb instead of evil. As I understand the Amazon situation, they trained a machine learning algorithm on the people that they had hired and it turned out that they rejected lots of women so the characteristics of women on resumes like playing on the women's volleyball team or studying women's studies, all became negative indicators of what it would mean to be a good Amazon employee.

I think that there is a possibility and this will see in Pollyanna, but there is a possibility that the fact that we have chosen to encode our biases, the way that Amazon encoded theirs in this machine learning system, makes them more inspectable and more fixable. And so Amazon was probably always a really sexist place and there maybe no one had any sort of understanding of how that came to be and they could tune the dial. You can actually, now that it's a dial, you can turn the dial and to be like, okay, let's be less sexist. Now is the world going to make those choices? Is Amazon going to make those choices?

I think a lot of us are scared of quantification in general and sort of if we somehow take irreducible human quantities and sort of bring them into data, are we somehow less human? One of the positives is that when we actually throw data at things, we can often see just how poorly we're doing. And even in sort of simple things like what percent of people hired by companies are female? Are people of color? So on and so forth. It gives us at least something that we can live up towards and hold people responsible for. The website is The Markup. You should be reading it. It's really remarkable.
