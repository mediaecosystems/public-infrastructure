Of course, there's been a couple of really frustrating Zooms where you see students going nuts because the teacher has muted everybody.

My favorite was a letter sent by the principal of a school district to parents, reminding them that while their kid is on Zoom School, they should probably be wearing clothing, if they're going to pass through the background of the Zoom Room, that while it's fine to smoke a joint at home, perhaps not smoking one, the size of a Cuban cigar while your child is trying to study. It really has been a moment where we've all had some insight into people's lives.

I have to say, despite the fact that involves so much staring at screens, it actually looks a lot more healthy in terms of sociability than a lot of what I was doing at his age, which seemed to involve, beating each other with sticks and the woods.

Evidently, I was acting sus, but what's been incredible is watching AOC, jump in and play these games. It's very, very clear that, she is what she says she is, which is to say she is a young person, deeply versed in internet culture. She is completely comfortable gaming on Twitch.

I've heard J LO is really excited about something that all over the internet, as we adjust it to these new screen lives. It was the rise of music live streaming. One of the most prominent examples of this was DJ D-Nice. He ran the Club Quarantine live streams on his Instagram live. Started off with a few hundred viewers, but within just a few weeks, he had over 100,000 each live stream, bringing on high-profile, main-stream guests like Rihanna, Michelle Obama, hip hop mogul, Mark Zuckerberg."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman"),":"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"But only because it was on Insta Live, right?

As parties shut down in- person around March, all of a sudden lots of dance parties moved to Amazon's Twitch streaming platform, everything from small underground parties that usually happen in the basement of a bath house in Pittsburgh, to really huge raves and the phenomenon is spread like wildfire. Chicago's Experimental Sound Studios, curated a live stream series called the Quarantine Concerts, which ended up being hosted by jazz and avant-garde, non-profits and clubs, and just to every American city that you can name running every single night, basically from April through June, raising over $100,000 in donations for performers who lost gigs and tours. On top of that, it was just a lot of fun, especially in the early days of the pandemic, where we didn't know what was going on, getting on a live stream, watching some music, chatting with people you never met before.

One of the musicians I've seen, two or three dozen times in person is Robyn Hitchcock, who is a wonderfully quirky singer songwriter, sort of out of the Syd Barrett hallucinogenic-style of stream of consciousness songwriting. He and his partner, Emma Swift have been performing weekly on StageIt. It's a platform that I hadn't seen before this year, but it's actually a lovely idea. You buy tokens for of 10 cents a piece. You have a suggested donation to see the show. It's usually suggested at five bucks, then people tip after each song and there's a live chat going on at the same time. For someone like Hitchcock, who tell stories between sets takes crazy requests it's kind of perfect. I mean, the way that you actually want to see this guy is feeling like he's sitting with you in your living room, and then you are literally sitting in your living room. You're air-playing it to your TV, and then you're giving him virtual tokens.

Right around the time the pandemic started, Bandcamp started waiving its own fees the first Friday of every month. So, 100% of the money that's someone paid for the album minus the PayPal or credit card fees would go directly to the artist. Around the time that the protest movements, spurred by the murder of church, George Floyd broke out, a group of people got together and made a big Google sheet, listing every single black musician they could find on Bandcamp, so that come the first Friday of the month, you could to directly financially support black people by buying their music. This turned into a website. You can visit it, blackbandcamp.info."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"It's a wonderful repository of just about every black person on Bandcamp across the world. Bandcamp has gone on to share this website themselves. It's a really wonderful example, one, of the power of supporting other people's music with money, which means it can help them continue to make music they love, and two, actually finding a way to financially support and lift up our black community members, which, hey, I'll tell you, in music, basically means supporting the people who innovate every major type of music that we love. That's how it's been for the entire 20th century. That's how it is now. It's exceedingly rare that the black people who made this happen, actually get the credit and the payment that they deserve.

We've seen a lot of movements online that are reacting to George Floyd, in part, by trying to get people to support black-owned businesses. We're seeing a lot of indices come up of black-owned bookstores, other black-owned small businesses, particularly as we're in the holiday season. Looking for those sites is a great way to go. It's also a nice moment to shout out Bandcamp, which is trying very hard to be orders of magnitude less evil than some of the other music platforms out there. One of the guests I hope that we'll get on, in the spring is my neighbor, Joe Holt, who actually wrote a good deal of the technical architecture for Bandcamp, who can talk a little bit about how that project came about. It was just a great year to look for music online."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"One of the things that I found myself coming back to, again and again, when I was feeling really down about 2020, was the Nandy Bushell story. I hope you guys saw this. Nandy Bushell is a ten-year old drummer from Ipswich, England. She describes herself as, as an Anglo-Zulu drummer and she just attacks the kit. She is a phenomenally talented player period. Not just for.10 or 11 years old, she's a really good player. She has this wonderful habit of screaming when she takes on a drum roll and she took on Nirvana's In Bloom and plays this. What's wonderful about this is someone passed it on to Dave Grohl, who'd actually drummed on that track with Nirvana. He's not a media guy, but it got passed to him by Butch Vig, the famous producer. Then, Bushell came around and did the Foo Fighters song, Everlong which in fact, Grohl hadn't drummed on, but challenged him to a drum battle."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman"),":"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"To his enormous credit, Dave Grohl came back and had a drum- off with her playing the same song, and they've been challenging each other back and forth.

I think it's a small thing and I think it's a fair from the S solution, but Snapchat started setting aside $1 million a day that it pays to the users who create its most highly trafficked content. If your video shows up in Snapchat's spotlight section that day, you get a cut of their $1 million. I think, it wouldn't be terrible to live in a world where instead of the big platforms making money off of selling our data, if they paid people for what they actually did to create value for those platforms? Does Snapchat still probably make money selling people's data? I'd be surprised if they didn't, but it's a step in the right direction. I hope that this is one of the things that helps readjust our expectations of how value is created for these giant companies and what we can get out of it."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman"),":"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Yeah. Mike, we're going to talk about platform cooperatives with Trevor Scholz coming up in a show and Snapchat's not the first to do this. YouTube, of course, has been paying creators for quite some time. But in general, it is a rethinking of that relationship between content creators and the tools that they're using. Chand, when we talk about YouTube Logic, which is a piece that we're going to have coming up soon. I know that you're going to want to talk a little bit about the ways in which the economies of YouTube make it a really unique platform. One of the things that I, honestly, have been most pleased with in 2020 is the pivot away from the illusion of neutrality. Platforms always like to tell us that they are neutral arbiters."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"They are not publishers. They are not deciding what goes on or what doesn't go on. We finally, really saw in 2020, mostly because of the utter explosion of misinformation, platforms starting to stand up and take some responsibility. It certainly came into focus with Trump's ongoing lies during, before, and certainly after the election, where he's claiming without evidence, to have won. But it started quite a bit earlier. The Plandemic video, this really, crazy-cakes video in which a thoroughly discredited scientist is claiming that wearing a mask will make the virus worse. The platforms decided that this was so dangerous and that because the CDC had explicitly put up different guidelines, that they would simply block it."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"It seemed like once you had Google and Facebook getting comfortable with blocking that video, it led them down this path where they got increasingly comfortable blocking other sorts of misinformation. I don't think we're going to see that put back in the bottle. I think the platforms are going to continue moving in that direction, in part, because the public is really demanding it. That's one prediction for 2021.

I'm going to go out on a limb. I'm going to say that if 2020 was the year that we all started paying attention to Chinese social media, through TikTok, 2021 is the rise of West African social media. I'm waiting for the Senegalese, the Ghanaians, the Nigerians in particular, to take their musical dominance and bring it up into social media dominance. I'm hoping that the Jollof wars, the great cultural battle between Nigerians and Ghanaians over a very popular rice dish, which frankly is much, much better in Ghana than it is in Nigeria, I am hoping that we will all be taking sides in this war between now and 2021 and that we all have strong, although probably ill-informed opinions about who makes the best Jollof."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Mike Sugarman"),":"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Yeah, my prediction for 2021, it's the hopeful one.

Mike Sugarman, Chand Rajendra-Nicolucci, it's been such a pleasure working with both of you all year. Mike, there's not a chance we would have gotten this podcast off the ground without you. Chand, in general, I would be much, much less smart about social networks and all of these issues, had we not had the chance to work together.
