I grew up in Silicon Valley. Both my parents are software engineers, just surrounded by tech my entire life. When I went to school, I studied electrical engineering, computer science, so kind of like the straight shot into technical work in Silicon Valley."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"But the flip side of that story is despite being on this almost perfect path into software, I actually felt a lot of headwinds. I would describe them as in hindsight, I think these headwinds were things like sexism and misogyny and just the general bias of Silicon Valley and tech culture."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So it was actually a bit of a struggle for me to enter the tech world, just feeling this resistance from peers, from managers. I did end up working as a software engineer in my first job out of school at Quora, and was kind of talked into that. I think partially out of the desperate need for software engineers that every company had, which was like, fine. Okay, please be an engineer. We need people to build things."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"And in that first job was when I actually really fell in love with software engineering because I realized how magical it is to be able to build things, to make things exist where they didn't exist before. And this was particularly pronounced at a really early stage startup. I joined as the second engineer hired onto the team. And so it really was creating things that didn't exist."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Somehow I had gotten through two engineering degrees at Stanford without realizing that engineering was about building things, but finally, in this first job I realized what it was about. So that was really cool."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"At the same time, starting to work professionally as a software engineer, I could see how much bias there was, also lack of representation, and seeing how those things would impact the quality of the products we were building."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"And one example I like to share is that the first thing I built at Quora was the block button because somebody, even though at that point we only had a few thousand users. I think somebody was already harassing me, and I just really wanted to be able to block him and stop any notifications coming from him. And because I felt very strongly about this, I advocated for that to be my project. And the rest of the team was fine with it, so that was what I worked on."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"But after I built it, I realized that if I hadn't been there with that specific experience advocating for that, having that point of view, it was very unlikely that that would've been prioritized so early. And-"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"In fact, we've seen with companies like Slack that have had hundreds of millions of users who had to be essentially begged to create a block button by their users who pointed out that just because you work with someone doesn't mean that they're not going to end up harassing you. So Quora in that sense, thank to your experience, was way ahead of the curve."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Tracy Chou:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Yeah, so I felt very lucky. It goes back to that idea of like, oh, I can create something. I can make something exist that wouldn't have otherwise. I think that was very powerful, but it also made me realize that for all the people who are not in the room, they can't manifest those things that they desire into these products and other discussions we had around what do women want were very distressing to me as the one woman who is like a 22 year old, recent grad called upon to speak on behalf of half of humanity, where I did not want to say that this is what women want or not. But as the only woman in the room, I had to make my best effort to at least share some perspective."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So with some of these experiences where simultaneously there's that power of technology and software engineering and also the lack of representation, which has very clear ramifications for the products we're building. You could see that was a big problem."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"On the cultural side as well. It just doesn't feel as fun to be in a very non-diverse team. And when there are certain cultural norms that are not particularly inclusive, it's just not a very fun day-to-day experience."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So that was part of what motivated my activism work, which I would largely describe as accidental. The earliest days it was actually because for Quora, which is a question answer site, a content site, we just needed to generate content. And so all of us who were early employees would be writing answers to questions. And the one thing I felt like I could speak authoritatively on was my own experience. I wasn't going to be able to compete with other people early on on the site who were experts in startups or VC or whatever it was."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"I was just a recent grad, but I could speak authentically to what is it like to be a woman in the computer science classroom? What is it like to be a woman in tech? And that was when I first started writing about that experience of being a minority in the field. And it was very encouraging to get the feedback from other folks on the platform. Even people who were not in the gender minority, but Black people would write to me and say like, \"Maybe it's not exactly the same experience. I'm not a woman, and I'm not actually an engineer, but I'm a Black person who works in tech, and I feel a lot of the same things that you do around being the only one being called upon to represent my entire group, feeling a bit out of place, and being forced to conform.\""),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So it was very rewarding, I guess, to get that feedback and realize that there were other folks out there who were having a similar experience, even though it's not great that we're all having this experience, but at least solidarity and validation that it's not just me and it's kind of a systemic issue."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Was Quora supportive of that? Were they happy that you were bringing up these issues and talking about this, I think, well-known, but no one loves the fact that the tech industry has real problems with bias and lack of diversity? Were you feeling pressured at Quora about that, or were they receptive to you talking openly about these issues?"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Tracy Chou:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"They were similar to many other firms at the time, which is to say not particularly progressive on this front. And one thing I found an interesting comparison was that on the engineering team, we would talk about how we wanted to build the best engineering culture, and the one every engineer would want to be in. We strived to be the best engineering team in the world with the best team for engineers to work at. And I posed a question once, which was, could we also aim to be the place that women most want to work at? And the response was like, \"Well, we're not worse than other places, so that seems fine.\" So it was more of a, we're happy to be average on this front."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"I felt much more support discussing diversity issues when I went to Pinterest. So I joined Pinterest, I left Quora about a year and a half after working there, and I joined Pinterest, and I felt very supported there to speak about these issues. And I think that is credit to the leadership team, which is very empathetic. And I think that also speaks for itself in the product where actually the founding team of Pinterest was three men. And a lot of the early user base was women. And I think it's due to their empathy and ability to listen to people who are not themselves and understand what they want, that they could build a product that could lead a team building a product that was serving a different kind of user base."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"And it was an interesting contrast between these two startups for me, where Quora was a very Silicon Valley type of startup where the earliest users were all Silicon Valley insiders. And Pinterest was very dedicated to not being on the Silicon Valley radar and putting off PR that was in tech press and really focusing on being where our potential users and customers were. And I don't think the focus on being very empathetic and understanding the users who are different from us, may not be that tech savvy, or they just have like different worlds, different aspirations. So I say Pinterest had more of a culture of empathy, which worked very well when I wanted to speak about these kinds of issues."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"On one of the pages explaining Block Party, you share a sample of essentially some of the hate that you've received on Twitter and on Facebook for the work that you're doing. Can you talk just a little bit about what does that feel like? Almost everybody listening to this podcast has had some experience of someone being mean to them on the internet, but you're really experiencing something categorically different. You're being attacked by people you don't know, who are pissed off that you are talking about issues that are deeply pervasive in society and in tech specifically. And then those attacks are getting deeply personal, really because you've been brave enough to stand up and do this work. What does that feel like?"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Tracy Chou:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"I think at this point I've developed a much thicker skin. So I'm trying to remember what it used to feel like, which was not very nice. I think you can probably imagine, like for most people, when somebody says something mean to you that is personally targeted, whether or not you think it's true, it could be feedback from a colleague or somebody horrible on the street shouting something at you. It doesn't feel very nice."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"And even if you know that you can ignore it because the person doesn't mean anything or their opinion doesn't matter, or they're not going to do anything to you, it still feels bad for at least a short period of time, sometimes even longer. I've frequently had the experience of seeing a negative comment, then having it run through my head for hours or days."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"In some cases, the more difficult cases are when there's very long feedback written to me. And it takes me a while to parse through it and understand that it's gaslighting or it's very sophisticated trolling."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"I'll back up a little bit and talk about different types of harassment. There's the high prevalent, low severity type of steps with a kind of like garden variety sexism, misogyny, drive by trolls ,people who are not particularly targeting anyone, but just have stuff they want to spew at folks on the internet. And then there's the really targeted stuff that can be a lot more disturbing, because it'll be very persistent, sometimes spanning many years. I've had a number of stalker harassers who've been after me for five, six, seven, eight years. They'll go away and pop back up, so there's this whole range of stuff."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"For the really high severity stuff, very targeted. I would try to report it. In some cases it would go to the police to try to do things about it, but there's not very much that can be done on that front."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"The stuff that was not as serious, but very high prevalence I realized was starting to just like really interrupt my day a lot where I check Twitter all the time because I'm addicted to Twitter, and I should check it less, but at the moment I'm still very addicted. I just check it all the time and realized that at many points throughout my day, I would feel the negativity of somebody posting really nasty comment towards me. And then I would feel it interrupt my emotional stability and then just be distracted from having checked Twitter and seeing something really negative."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So some of the response to that I would take would be trying very hard to not check Twitter, just turn off my, delete the app or turn off my phone, but I always end up going back and then just be really frustrated because I still want to get all the good stuff, see all the news, interesting opinions from people I respect, all the different perspectives.

We get very extreme in our opinions and talk about how they're all so terrible, but-"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"We're going through a real quit Facebook cycle, and of course people don't talk about the fact that even with all the manyfold dysfunctions of Facebook, there's some lovely thing about it, as well."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Tracy Chou:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Right, there's really good stuff, which is why we're there. If it were all a hundred percent bad, we would have no trouble leaving those platforms, but it is that balance of positive to negative."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So Block Party came about partially from these experiences dealing with harassment, but also the experiences that I had from working as an engineer at different platform companies and understanding how these platforms are built, how decisions get made internally, what is prioritized. Also where a third party could sit and improve the experience for users."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So it was the combination of these experiences, I think, put me at this very cool intersection where I could think about problem solving with product and engineering and with the lived experience of dealing with this problem, understanding the trade offs and the emotional impact of this stuff."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"One thing I found very interesting around trust and safety and a lot of the anti-harassment work that has been done inside platforms and with some third parties is there's a big focus on machine learning, which I think is useful in certain cases. There's a lot of stuff that can be automated, but there's also a lot that machine learning can't do. I think the emphasis on using machine learning to solve all these problems comes a lot of times from folks who don't experience the problem and are very enamored of the technology and would like the technology to be a perfect solution."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"And as somebody who does experience the problem well, and in addition has built machine learning based moderation tools and worked on machine learning models and various capacities before, I also know what the limits of machine learning are, and I know how much, just really simple heuristics and user understanding can do."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"If we just think about not showing potentially upsetting stuff to people, you don't have to be perfect on your filtering mechanisms. You can drastically improve people's mental health by just not showing them stuff and allowing them to review it when they want to."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So that is what Block Party does in its core product. We allow people to set up filtering options, and you can configure them to be higher or lower. You can change at any time. Also understanding that people's desire to engage with different types of content can change depending on emotional capacity. I felt that with myself, sometimes I'm more open to seeing what the internet has to fling at me, and other times I don't want to engage.

You don't need a super fancy machine learning classifier to predict the likelihood that somebody is going to be annoying to you. You can just use a heuristic like they liked a really obnoxious harassing tweet about you.

How does Twitter feel about the product?"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Tracy Chou:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Twitter's been very, very supportive, which has been great. They've obviously had a varied history with developers on their platform in the past. I think right now, generally folks are coming to a realization that it is good to have a developer ecosystem and have other people engaged in solving these problems that you potentially can't solve on your own as a platform. There are certain things that the platforms, I think, should take a lot of responsibility for and other things that are maybe better to open up to other folks able to build more custom solutions."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So I think that is where we are right now in the thinking between platform and third party. There's certain things that the platform is going to do, and then things that maybe they view as not on their high priority roadmap, but would still benefit a good chunk of users. Maybe that's better for third parties to build."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"There are some challenges that platforms will also experience when they build out too much of this functionality, where they could be accused of censorship, or you're balancing a lot of different concerns as a platform, right, where oftentimes efforts to deal with harassment, like anti-harassment, anti-spam efforts may also have impacts on the spread of misinformation or disinformation."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So one example of this on Twitter's side would be being able to limit who replies to your tweets. So in one way you can think of it as the person who tweets being able to control their space, where the replies to their tweet is their space. And the analogy to other platforms might be if you post something, you can lock the comments on your post."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"It's a little bit different on Twitter though, where the replies are the same primacy as the original tweet. Everything is a tweet in the system. People can't post it from their own account and just tag you, and so it's a little bit different."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"And then the other thing with Twitter is oftentimes people use the replies to debunk misinformation. And I personally, when I'm looking around at tweets going viral, sometimes I'm not sure if I should believe what's in the original tweet. I just go scroll through all the replies and see what other people said. If there's something that was wrong in the original tweet, probably somebody has flagged it in the replies. So limiting replies totally and letting the original author completely control that can cut off one of the best mechanisms for counteracting misinformation."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Twitter is slowly taking responsibility for some of the toxicity of its own space. Twitter can't really do anything about Instagram or about Facebook or things like that. Facebook is not known for being open to third party tools in the same way that that Twitter has been.

I would love for that to become the standard. And then that kind of facilitates the flourishing of third party customization on people's experience."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"The way that I imagine things could move in a much better future for social media is people can choose their own experiences.

You can actually choose your own experience based on what makes sense for you."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Some people have talked about this idea of middleware or choose your own algorithms.

Facebook has said, "We\'re not going to let you do that."'),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Tracy, at this point, I often ask people to talk about their imagined better internet. You're sort of two steps ahead of it. You've imagined an internet that's being built by more women and more people of color and is transparent about where it's falling short on that. You're imagining an internet where people have the tools to control their experience so that they have increased control over countering harassment. What does that world look like?
