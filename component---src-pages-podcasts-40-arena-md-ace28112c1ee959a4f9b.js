He's also a partner at No Plans, a web development studio. Charles is a software engineer, the CEO of Are.na. Prior to co-founding Are.na, Charles was a practicing artist in New York City. We're going to talk today about this really platform. And one of the first things we actually have to talk about is what is Are.na. My partner asked me who I was interviewing this morning, and I explained that Are.na was Pinterest, but significantly less evil. It turns out that Charles has actually dedicated a whole channel of Are.na to the question of how you might describe it."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Some of the people have a social place where people can watch your mental notes.

I usually do lean on Pinterest and just say, it's Pinterest, but a little bit nerdier. And then I would go on to describe what one does or what I do specifically, which is on Are.na you have two it's, one is block, which is sort of like a file. It could be an image, a text, a link, any kind of file. Wait, I said a file, a PDF, YouTube, SoundCloud, anything like that, you can pretty much, anything can be represented in a block. Most things can be represented in a block and in a channel, which is a collection of blocks. And that's almost the entire rule set and there's various levels of privacy. And people use those two units to sort of organize information, sort of put their research into collections, use other people's resources as in their own research and things get cross connected and messy and fun."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Daniel, as a designer in all of this, the cross connected and messy strikes me as a really interesting challenge.

We did through try to explore in the horizontality of it and try to focus design wise on the details and the single actions, and to make those as intuitive as they are.

I think the reason why this is hard is, I don't know, it's a good question. It takes a particular kind of mindset where you're sort of looking at something that you're seeing and kind of looking at it in a more active way. Like you are imagining where this piece of information fits into your own world and making that leap from just sort of passively consuming something to deciding if this piece of information is important. And if so, where it lives in your sort of universe of thought. It's a little bit of a leap, I think, but I think it's not something that is just like a particular kind of person. I think it's a behavior that can be learned.

So let's lean into that for a moment. So, one of the ways to describe Are.na is things that it doesn't have. It doesn't have advertising. It doesn't have an algorithm that drives a feed. It doesn't have an attempt to personalize itself to your own needs. You guys are really admirably transparent about the financial model and sort of the revenues associated with it. As of this morning, this site has 7,480 premium users, who are paying either $5 a month or $45 a year. That contrast pretty sharply to we've invoked Pinterest a couple of times in this conversation, PayPal just dismissed rumors that they were about to purchase Pinterest for $45 billion. So, is this a sustainable business? And maybe more than that, why organize it this way? We're at this moment where people are paying truly mind boggling sums of money for people organizing themselves in different ways online. And you seem to have something that's genuinely you useful that people are extraordinarily passionate about. And yet, you've failed to cash your billion dollar checks."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Charles Broskoski:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Yeah, I think for us, so we've been running Are.na for, or Are.na has been around for more than 10 years now. And at the beginning, when we started talking about it, when it was more of a prototype, we knew that it was going to be in this space where people would be using it to sort of think through their own ideas. And when that is sort of the premise of the business or the platform, having a business model that doesn't interfere with that is... You know what I mean, like advertising can't come into play there because you're thwarting your ability to provide that service. So, we wanted a very straightforward relationship and to have a sort of motivation for ourselves to just make the platform good enough that people are, are willing to pay for it. And for people also to know on the flip side, that is the relationship. And our role is only as maintainer and stewards, and people who are improving the platform. And that we're all sort of shaping this fairly amorphous open ended platform together."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Daniel Pianetti:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"I think that peace of mind is a big factor because it's a peace of mind for us and for the members, knowing that we don't depend on other people and that the operation can go on in a healthy way. And of course the first years there wasn't peace of mind because you're worried you're not making enough money to even cover infrastructure cost. But I think about a year ago where we finally reached a point where we safely pay for all infrastructures, we start paying ourself, decently. That was a very good moment. And when we also realized we don't need a third party intervention, monetary intervention."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So, the project manages to sustain itself in terms of infrastructure, in terms of being able to pay both of you. Is there donated time that keeps it going? Is there sort of community love that keeps it going?

So, we have some other people who are working part-time as well. Parts of Are.na are open source. We don't get that many poll requests, but I would say that community love definitely keeps it afloat, emotionally. We have a pretty active community and we also have an API that people are kind of using and building tools off of. So yeah, it is possible. And I think it's probably even more possible now than it was when we started. To run something sustainably that one or two people can do by themselves."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So, who are those users? I mean, you've got roughly 8,000 of them, it sounds like you're paying quite close attention to them. Is there such a thing as the average Are.na user?

I think, because that kind of information categorization, curation thing is something that comes natural to those people. So, it's already something that they're feeling like they want or need a tool for. But I would say the other portion is really hard to categorize. Yeah, I think it's more of a kind of like psychographic than it is of a demographic. It's people who are, I mean, we have this really cheesy term, but we say, connected knowledge collectors. And I think it's people who are sort of interested in pursuing lots of different disciplines. People who are interested in directing their own learning or education."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Are.na has a free mode where you can have up to 200 blocks and channels, and then sort of after that you end up paying for it. So, it really does make a great sense as an educational tool. My student Alexis Hope ran, not the similar platform called Fold, which had some Are.na like features to, it was much more of a blogging and writing platform. And we saw the same dynamic. We saw classes sort of come and experiment with, and we'd hope to hold onto a few of them afterwards. Because there is an open, free version of this, you potentially face the problem that everyone else does, which is the problems of moderation. What do you do when someone creates a really disturbing collection or someone creates a collection of abusive imagery, or something along those lines. How does moderation work within the community trials?"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Charles Broskoski:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Yeah, so we have a set of community guidelines that we feel like is fairly reasonable, but thankfully even in our 10 year history, we haven't had, I mean, knock on wood, we haven't had really any instances where it's been too bad. In a case where someone is uploading abusive imagery. We take an approach where we're like a small library, and we don't have the resources to sort of debate something that... You know what I mean, we would just take it down."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"And the cases that are, I think maybe a little bit trickier are ones where, because Are.na is sort of a research platform, those cases where someone is researching something that might be a sensitive subject. And in those cases, we've had people reach out, flag a channel, and then we've reached out to the person and just sort of asked for an explanation. And then, usually, it comes to just marking the channel as not safe work and adding a disclaimer to the description that these are for research. And the person actually, I think they were linking to an essay that they were writing also. So yeah, I think we're lucky that it hasn't come up much, but I think it will come up more."),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,(0,i.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Ethan Zuckerman:")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"So, the current approach is essentially, it's a library, you're the librarian.

That's most of it. Yeah. That's the policy now. And I think our approach is like, we use this guarded metaphor a lot.

The first time a deer jumps into your garden, you realize you have to put up a fence. You know what I mean? We're not going to lock things down until we sort of know it's appropriate. Yeah.

And so, first of all, I don't think you're wrong. Right? I think one of the things that interests me about Are.na is that on the one hand, it feels like a community in the sense of there's a lot of quirky people sort of exploring their own form of connection.

Some people are super vocal about the kinds of directions that they want to see Are.na go in. And I think the way that we handle that is like I said, just being available, but also making our plans, like our roadmap is also publicly available. We publish investor reports twice a year, that we talk about the sort of long term directions that we're going in. So, I think the people who have been involved for a while have a really strong sense of where we think we should go. And also, I think those people have a hand in pushing that direction of where we want to go. We also have an open channel on Are.na that's feedback and feature requests where people will just add the features that they want.

Going back to what we said before, some projects are too slow and they become too small and forgotten. But most of the projects now tend to, or they aim at being extremely performative and big and fast, but there is a way in the middle that creates meaningful products and companies. And that's something, I think it's a big contrast now with the web three. The principles and concept and ideas go towards a nice space, but the speed of it and the frenzy's incredible.
